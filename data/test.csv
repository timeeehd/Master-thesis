"	"And so I made no refusing of the tablets ; for I  did need them , that I make blood again within me , else should I be  lacking , when that there came any need anigh .  And we kist each the tablets of the other , and did drink from the same  cup , and did be utter happy ; and did be part like children , but also to  be man and maid .  And presently , the Maid did shift my bandages , as alway , and washt me  proper , and had me into comfort . But she did keep me alway very  low - lying ; and truly I scarce to mind ; for I was not gotten enough of my  strength , to give me to feel irked . And further , as you shall think ,  there did be that lovely One with me alway ; and did make sweet quips  unto me , and talkt and did laugh , and oft did come into singing ; for she  did be so sweetly joyed that I was in life and did mend so proper .  And afterward , she went off from me a little , to her toilet ; but I to  ask that she be so swift as might be , and she to promise very merry ; and  she came back in a little while , and her hair to be in a lovely cloud  about her shoulders , and her pretty feet yet to be bared from her bath ,  which she had in a pool beyond some bushes ; and she to say that I did be  so impatient a man , that she to be forced that she do the half of her  dressing with me ; but truly , she came thiswise only because she to know  how I did delight in her thus , and to watch the way that she set up her  abundance of hair ; and she to be hungry also that she be with me , and to  love me that I watch her , even while that there did be oft a little and  quaint stirring of shyness in her dear heart .  And I had her to come beside me , and to sit anigh to my hand ; and I made  presently that I did scold her , because that she had no proper care to  her pretty feet ; and I bid her to set her feet toward me , that I look  the more close at them .

"<fairy> While he was washing the King passed by , and the Cat  began to cry out :  “ Help ! help ! My Lord Marquis of Carabas is going to be drowned .
"	"”  At this noise the King put his head out of the coach - window , and ,  finding it was the Cat who had so often brought him such good game ,  he commanded his guards to run immediately to the assistance of his  Lordship the Marquis of Carabas . While they were drawing the poor  Marquis out of the river , the Cat came up to the coach and told the King  that , while his master was washing , there came by some rogues , who  went off with his clothes , though he had cried out : “ Thieves ! thieves ! ”   several times , as loud as he could .  This cunning Cat had hidden them under a great stone . The King  immediately commanded the officers of his wardrobe to run and fetch one  of his best suits for the Lord Marquis of Carabas .  The King caressed him after a very extraordinary manner , and as the fine  clothes he had given him extremely set off his good mien ( for he was  well made and very handsome in his person ) , the King ’s daughter took a  secret inclination to him , and the Marquis of Carabas had no sooner cast  two or three respectful and somewhat tender glances but she fell in love  with him to distraction . The King would needs have him come into the  coach and take part of the airing . The Cat , quite overjoyed to see his  project begin to succeed , marched on before , and , meeting with some  countrymen , who were mowing a meadow , he said to them :  “ Good people , you who are mowing , if you do not tell the King that  the meadow you mow belongs to my Lord Marquis of Carabas , you shall be  chopped as small as herbs for the pot . ”  The King did not fail asking of the mowers to whom the meadow they were  mowing belonged .  “ To my Lord Marquis of Carabas , ” answered they altogether , for the Cat ’s  threats had made them terribly afraid .  “ You see , sir , ” said the Marquis , “ this is a meadow which never fails to  yield a plentiful harvest every year . ”  The Master Cat , who went still on before , met with some reapers , and  said to them :  “ Good people , you who are reaping , if you do not tell the King that all  this corn belongs to the Marquis of Carabas , you shall be chopped as  small as herbs for the pot . ”  The King , who passed by a moment after , would needs

"	"Tranquilly permitting these  irregular cursings to evaporate , Stubb then in a plain , business - like ,  but still half humorous manner , cursed Pip officially ; and that done ,  unofficially gave him much wholesome advice . The substance was , Never  jump from a boat , Pip , except — but all the rest was indefinite , as the  soundest advice ever is . Now , in general , _ Stick to the boat _ , is your  true motto in whaling ; but cases will sometimes happen when _ Leap from  the boat _ , is still better . Moreover , as if perceiving at last that if  he should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip , he would be  leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future ; Stubb suddenly  dropped all advice , and concluded with a peremptory command , “ Stick to  the boat , Pip , or by the Lord , I wo n’t pick you up if you jump ; mind  that . We ca n’t afford to lose whales by the likes of you ; a whale would  sell for thirty times what you would , Pip , in Alabama . Bear that in  mind , and do n’t jump any more . ” Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted ,  that though man loved his fellow , yet man is a money - making animal ,  which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence .  But we are all in the hands of the Gods ; and Pip jumped again . It was  under very similar circumstances to the first performance ; but this  time he did not breast out the line ; and hence , when the whale started  to run , Pip was left behind on the sea , like a hurried traveller ’s  trunk . Alas ! Stubb was but too true to his word . It was a beautiful ,  bounteous , blue day ; the spangled sea calm and cool , and flatly  stretching away , all round , to the horizon , like gold - beater ’s skin  hammered out to the extremest . Bobbing up and down in that sea , Pip ’s  ebon head showed like a head of cloves . No boat - knife was lifted when  he fell so rapidly astern . Stubb ’s inexorable back was turned upon him ;  and the whale was winged . In three minutes , a whole mile of shoreless  ocean was between Pip and Stubb . Out from the centre of the sea , poor  Pip turned his crisp , curling , black head to the sun , another lonely  castaway , though the loftiest and the brightest .  Now , in calm weather , to swim in

"	"He traveled for two  days and two nights in a day coach and , outside of the fact that he  absolutely refused to leave the train at any moment for fear of seeing  it go off without him , he appeared to enjoy the trip .  In Montreal he seemed to fight shy of the streets and preferred to  remain in the lobby of the small hotel where a room had been reserved  for him . He sat there all day , looking through the window .  On his return to the hunting grounds , he met me on my way south and told  me how much he had liked his journey to the big city . Through sheer  curiosity , I asked him then what had surprised him the most while he was  in civilization . Was it the sight of the trains , motor cars , street  cars , the telephone , the electric lights or the stone houses ? No , none  of these things seemed to have impressed him in the slightest . Finally  he admitted that there was one thing that had astonished him , and that  was the people in the street in front of his hotel . All those people  walking so fast and passing one another without a sign . People who never  stopped to speak . People who did not seem to know one another . That , he  could not fathom at all .                              Tale V : A Pilot  Into the lower part of Ungava Bay flows a vicious , treacherous , steel  grey river called the Koksoak . Fifteen miles up that river there lies a  big trading station which deals with Eskimos from the barren lands and  with the Nascopi Indians from the interior of Labrador .  Tides in Ungava Bay vary from twenty to thirty feet . A 3,000-ton steamer  can reach the station safely , but she must steam up the river on the  flood of the tide two or three hours after the turn . The native pilot  alone , through certain land marks known to him , can judge the exact time  when to start . He alone can steer the ship ’s course through the winding  narrow channel which , amidst whirlpools and rapids , between rocks and  through narrow gorges , leads to a safe anchorage fifteen miles inland in  front of the Post .  At first , and during several years afterwards , we had used a small  100-ton auxiliary schooner to bring in the yearly supplies . Finally we  decided to take the risk of calling at Fort Chimo , for such is the name  of the Post , with our new steamer of 1,000 tons .  That year when we anchored at the mouth

"<fairy> "" And the Blue Bird 's  song was very loud and sweet .
"	" Then suddenly the King saw coming through the sky the great straggling ,  sprawling , wicked shape of the Red Dragon . And he knew at once what he  must do . He caught up _ The Book of Beasts _ and jumped on the back of the  gentle , beautiful Hippogriff , and leaning down he whispered in the  sharp , white ear : "" Fly , dear Hippogriff , fly your very fastest to the  Pebbly Waste . ""  And when the Dragon saw them start , he turned and flew after them , with  his great wings flapping like clouds at sunset , and the Hippogriff 's  wide wings were snowy as clouds at moonrise .  When the people in the town saw the Dragon fly off after the Hippogriff  and the King they all came out of their houses to look , and when they  saw the two disappear they made up their minds to the worst , and began  to think what they would wear for Court mourning .  But the Dragon could not catch the Hippogriff . The red wings were bigger  than the white ones , but they were not so strong , and so the  white - winged horse flew away and away and away , with the Dragon  pursuing , till he reached the very middle of the Pebbly Waste .  Now , the Pebbly Waste is just like the parts of the seaside where there  is no sand -- all round , loose , shifting stones , and there is no grass  there and no tree within a hundred miles of it .  Lionel jumped off the white horse 's back in the very middle of the  Pebbly Waste , and he hurriedly unclasped _ The Book of Beasts _ and laid  it open on the pebbles . Then he clattered among the pebbles in his haste  to get back on to his white horse , and had just jumped on when up came  the Dragon . He was flying very feebly , and looking around everywhere for  a tree , for it was just on the stroke of twelve , the sun was shining  like a gold guinea in the blue sky , and there was not a tree for a  hundred miles .  The white - winged horse flew around and around the Dragon as he writhed  on the dry pebbles . He was getting very hot : indeed , parts of him even  had begun to smoke . He knew that he must certainly catch fire in  another minute unless he could get under a tree . He made a snatch with  his red claws at the King and Hippogriff , but he was too feeble to reach  them , and besides ,

"<fairy>  "" We hovered on the outskirts of the rooms till four o'clock came .
"	"We  sat on the stairs and watched the big clock , which I was just learning  to read ; and Patty made herself giddy with constantly looking up and  counting the four strokes , towards which the hour hand slowly moved .  We put our noses into the kitchen now and then , to smell the cakes  and get warm , and anon we hung about the parlour door , and were most  unjustly accused of trying to peep . What did we care what our mother  was doing in the parlour?--we who had seen Old Father Christmas  himself , and were expecting him back again every moment !  "" At last the church clock struck . The sounds boomed heavily through  the frost , and Patty thought there were four of them . Then , after due  choking and whirring , our own clock struck , and we counted the strokes  quite clearly -- one ! two ! three ! four ! Then we got Kitty 's shawl once  more , and stole out into the back - yard . We ran to our old place , and  peeped , but could see nothing .  "" ' We 'd better get up on to the wall , ' I said ; and with some difficulty  and distress from rubbing her bare knees against the cold stones , and  getting the snow up her sleeves , Patty got on the coping of the little  wall . I was just struggling after her , when something warm and  something cold coming suddenly against the bare calves of my legs ,  made me shriek with fright . I came down ' with a run , ' and bruised my  knees , my elbows , and my chin ; and the snow that had n't gone up  Patty 's sleeves , went down my neck . Then I found that the cold thing  was a dog 's nose , and the warm thing was his tongue ; and Patty cried  from her post of observation , ' It 's Father Christmas 's dog , and he 's  licking your legs . '  "" It really was the dirty little brown and white spaniel ; and he  persisted in licking me , and jumping on me , and making curious little  noises , that must have meant something if one had known his language .  I was rather harassed at the moment . My legs were sore , I was a little  afraid of the dog , and Patty was very much afraid of sitting on the  wall without me .  "" ' You wo n't fall , ' I said to her . ' Get down , will you ! ' I said to the  dog .  "" '

"<fantasy>  But they were scarcely on their way again before the aforesaid south - east  wind began to grow bigger , and at last blew a gale , and brought up with  it a drift of fine snow , through which they yet made their way , but  slowly , till the drift grew so thick that they could not see each other  five paces apart .
"	" Then perforce they made stay , and gathered together under a bent which by  good luck they happened upon , where they were sheltered from the worst of  the drift .   There they abode , till in less than an hour ’s space the drift  abated and the wind fell , and in a little while after it was quite clear ,  with the sun shining brightly and the young waxing moon white and high up  in the heavens ; and the frost was harder than ever .  This seemed good to them ; but now that they could see each other ’s faces  they fell to telling over their company , and there was none missing save  Face - of - god .   They were somewhat dismayed thereat , but knew not what to  do , and they deemed he might not be far off , either a little behind or a  little ahead ; and Hall - face said :  ‘ There is no need to make this to - do about my brother ; he can take good  care of himself ; neither does a warrior of the Face die because of a  little cold and frost and snow - drift .   Withal Gold - mane is a wilful man ,  and of late days hath been wilful beyond his wo nt ; let us now find the  elks . ’  So they went on their ways hoping to fall in with him again .   No long  story need be made of their hunting , for not very far from where they had  taken shelter they came upon the elks , many of them , impounded in the  drifts , pretty much where the deft hunters looked to find them .   There  then was battle between the elks and the men , till the beasts were all  slain and only one man hurt : then they made them sleighs from wood which  they found in the hollows thereby , and they laid the carcasses thereon ,  and so turned their faces homeward , dragging their prey with them .   But  they met not Face - of - god either there or on the way home ; and Hall - face  said : ‘ Maybe Gold - mane will lie on the fell to - night ; and I would I were  with him ; for adventures oft befall such folk when they abide in the  wilds . ’  Now it was late at night by then they reached Burgstead , so laden as they  were with the dead beasts ; but they heeded the night little , for the moon  was well - nigh as bright as day for them .

Laurie says he is  fast , and I do n’t consider him a desirable acquaintance , so I let him  alone . ”  “ You might treat him civilly , at least . You gave him a cool nod , and  just now you bowed and smiled in the politest way to Tommy Chamberlain ,  whose father keeps a grocery store . If you had just reversed the nod  and the bow , it would have been right , ” said Amy reprovingly .  “ No , it would n’t , ” returned Jo , “ I neither like , respect , nor admire  Tudor , though his grandfather ’s uncle ’s nephew ’s niece was a third  cousin to a lord .

"<fantasy>   When she woke again it was  broad daylight , the sun was up , and a little ripple was running over the  face of the water .
"	"  She stepped ashore straightway , and looked up the  land and to the right hand and the left , and saw at once that it was  indeed the Isle of Queens , and the house stood trim and lovely as of old  time ; then she longed somewhat to tread the green meadow a little , for  yet young was the day , and she saw nought stirring save the throstle and  a few small beasts .   However , she said to herself that she would go  nowhere nigh to the goodly house wherein abode those images of death .  Yet her body longed so sore for the springtide freshness of the grass ,  and was so bewooed of the flowery scent thereof , that though she durst  not go unarmed , she did off her footgear and went stealing softly  barefoot and with naked legs over the embroidered greensward , saying  aloud to herself : If run for the ferry I needs must , lighter shall I run  so dight .  Nonetheless , she had gone but a little way ere a terror took hold of her ,  though she saw no child of Adam anigh , and she turned and ran back  swiftly to her old place and sat down under a twisted oak - tree hard by  the Sending Boat , and abode there panting and quaking , and scarce daring  to look up from the grass for a while .   Then her heart came back to her ,  and she laughed , and said to herself : I am a fool , for I need fear nought  on this Isle of Queens save women like myself .  Yet she sat there a little while longer without stirring ; then she stood  up and looked keenly around , and , as aforesaid , exceeding far - sighted she  was ; but still she saw neither man nor maid nor suckling child .  Then her eyes sought the lips of the lake , and rested on a little bight  some stone ’s throw ahead of the Sending Boat , where , a little back from  the water , slim willows made a veil betwixt the water of the meadow ; and  she looked , and saw how pleasant a place it were for a one to stand and  look on the ripple just left , while the water dripped from the clear body  on to the grass .   And her bare feet fell to telling her clad sides of the  sweet coolness of the water , and waited for no naysay , but lightly bore  her toward the willowy bight .   And when she was there , she did off her  sallet and ungirt her , and laid her sword on the

"" I do n't think they were very neat , "" said the little girl .  Well , they were kind - hearted , anyway , and they felt sorry for the other  little girl . And she began to think she had made some little impression  on them , when she noticed the old hen - turkey beginning to untie her  bonnet strings , and the turkey chicks began to spread round her in a  circle , with the points of their wings touching , so that she could n't  get out , and they commenced dancing and singing , and after a while that  little he - turkey says , "" Who 's _ it _ ?

"	" Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village , Huckleberry  Finn , son of the town drunkard . Huckleberry was cordially hated and  dreaded by all the mothers of the town , because he was idle and lawless  and vulgar and bad — and because all their children admired him so , and  delighted in his forbidden society , and wished they dared to be like  him . Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys , in that he envied  Huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition , and was under strict orders  not to play with him . So he played with him every time he got a chance .  Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast - off clothes of full - grown  men , and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags . His hat  was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim ; his coat ,  when he wore one , hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons  far down the back ; but one suspender supported his trousers ; the seat of  the trousers bagged low and contained nothing , the fringed legs dragged  in the dirt when not rolled up .  Huckleberry came and went , at his own free will . He slept on doorsteps  in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet ; he did not have to go to  school or to church , or call any being master or obey anybody ; he could  go fishing or swimming when and where he chose , and stay as long as it  suited him ; nobody forbade him to fight ; he could sit up as late as he  pleased ; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring  and the last to resume leather in the fall ; he never had to wash , nor  put on clean clothes ; he could swear wonderfully . In a word , everything  that goes to make life precious that boy had . So thought every harassed ,  hampered , respectable boy in St. Petersburg .  Tom hailed the romantic outcast :  “ Hello , Huckleberry ! ”  “ Hello yourself , and see how you like it . ”  “ What ’s that you got ? ”  “ Dead cat . ”  “ Lemme see him , Huck . My , he ’s pretty stiff . Where ’d you get him ? ”  “ Bought him off’n a boy . ”  “ What did you give ? ”  “ I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter - house . ”  “ Where ’d you get the blue ticket ? ”  “ Bought it

The  good dame their mother lived in great penitence , and much she did of good  deeds and alms ; and Messire Thibault lived as the worthy which he was ,  and much did he of good whiles he was in life .

My faithful warriors , and my household , and my  foster - brothers , is there not one among you who will stand the blow in my  stead ? ”   “ There is not , verily , ” answered they .

"	"I certainly  should have represented it to Edward in a very strong light . ‘ My dear  fellow , ’ I should have said , ‘ consider what you are doing . You are  making a most disgraceful connection , and such a one as your family are  unanimous in disapproving . ’ I can not help thinking , in short , that  means might have been found . But now it is all too late . He must be  starved , you know , that is certain ; absolutely starved . ”  He had just settled this point with great composure , when the entrance  of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject . But though _ she _ never  spoke of it out of her own family , Elinor could see its influence on  her mind , in the something like confusion of countenance with which she  entered , and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself . She  even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her  sister were so soon to leave town , as she had hoped to see more of  them;—an exertion in which her husband , who attended her into the room ,  and hung enamoured over her accents , seemed to distinguish every thing  that was most affectionate and graceful .  CHAPTER XLII .  One other short call in Harley Street , in which Elinor received her  brother ’s congratulations on their travelling so far towards Barton  without any expense , and on Colonel Brandon ’s being to follow them to  Cleveland in a day or two , completed the intercourse of the brother and  sisters in town;—and a faint invitation from Fanny , to come to Norland  whenever it should happen to be in their way , which of all things was  the most unlikely to occur , with a more warm , though less public ,  assurance , from John to Elinor , of the promptitude with which he should  come to see her at Delaford , was all that foretold any meeting in the  country .  It amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to send  her to Delaford;—a place , in which , of all others , she would now least  chuse to visit , or wish to reside ; for not only was it considered as  her future home by her brother and Mrs. Jennings , but even Lucy , when  they parted , gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there .  Very early in April , and tolerably early in the day , the two parties  from Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set out from their respective  homes , to meet , by appointment , on the

"<fantasy> To the ordinary mendicants  of the city this stress of competition was disastrous , but to Yuen Yan  it was overwhelming .
"	"Thoroughly imbued with the deferential systems of  antiquity , he led his band from place to place with a fitting regard  for the requirements of ceremonial etiquette and a due observance of  leisurely unconcern . Those to whom he addressed himself he approached  with obsequious tact , and in the face of refusal to contribute to his  store his most violent expedient did not go beyond marshalling his  company of suppliants in an orderly group upon the shop floor , where  they sang in unison a composed chant extolling the fruits of  munificence and setting forth the evil plight which would certainly  attend the flinty - stomached in the Upper Air . In this way Yuen Yan had  been content to devote several hours to a single shop in the hope of  receiving finally a few pieces of brass money ; but now his  persecutions were so mild that the merchants and vendors rather  welcomed him by comparison with the intolerable Ho , and would on no  account pay to be relieved of the infliction of his presence . “ Have we  not disbursed in one day to the piratical Ho thrice the sum which we  had set by to serve its purpose for a hand - count of moons ; and do we  possess the Great Secret ? ” they cried . “ Nevertheless , dispose your  engaging band of mendicants about the place freely until it suits your  refined convenience to proceed elsewhere , O meritorious Yuen Yan , for  your unassuming qualities have won our consistent regard ; but an  insatiable sponge has already been laid upon the well - spring of our  benevolence and the tenacity of our closed hand is inflexible . ”  Even the passive mendicants began to murmur against his leadership ,  urging him that he should adopt some of the simpler methods of the  gifted Ho and thereby save them all from an otherwise inevitable  starvation . The Emperor Kai - tsing , said the one who led their voices  ( referring in his malignant bitterness to a sovereign of the previous  dynasty ) , was dead , although the fact had doubtless escaped Yuen Yan ’s  deliberate perception . The methods of four thousand years ago were  becoming obsolete in the face of a strenuous competition , and unless  Yuen Yan was disposed to assume a more highly - coiled appearance they  must certainly address themselves to another leader .  It was on this occasion that the incident took place which has passed  down in the form of an inspiriting proverb . Yuen Yan had  conscientiously delivered at the door of his abode the last of his  company and was turning his footsteps towards his own arch when he  encountered the contumelious Ho ,

Then a hind came out of the thicket and stood on the sunlit glade ,     And turned her head toward the oak tree and a step on toward me made .     Then stopped , and bounded aback , and away as if in fear ,     That I saw her no more ; then I wondered , though sitting close anear     Was a she - wolf great and grisly .

There she sat as though she were watching , and o'er head a blue - winged     jay     Shrieked out from the topmost oak - twigs , and a squirrel ran his way     Two tree - trunks off .

"	"  Now we have set ourselves to  seek that woman , and if thou be she , we would ask a question of thy  wisdom . '  "" I answered that I was even such as they had heard of , and bade them  ask .  "" Said the old man :  "" ' Fifty years ago , when I was yet but a young man , there was a fair  woman who was Queen of the Land of the Tower and whom we loved sorely  because we had dwelt together with her amidst tribulation in the desert  and the wildwood :   and we are not of her people , but a fellowship of  free men and champions hight the Men of the Dry Tree :   and we hoped  that she would one day come back and dwell with us and be our Lady and  Queen : and indeed trouble seemed drawing anigh her , so that we might  help her and she might become our fellow again , when lo ! she vanished  away from the folk and none knew where she was gone .   Therefore a band  of us of the Dry Tree swore an oath together to seek her till we found  her , that we might live and die together : but of that band of one score  and one , am I the last one left that seeketh ; for the rest are dead , or  sick , or departed : and indeed I was the youngest of them .   But for  these two men , they are my sons whom I have bred in the knowledge of  these things and in the hope of finding tidings of our Lady and Queen ,  if it were but the place where her body lieth .   Thou art wise : knowest  thou the resting place of her bones ? ""  "" When I had heard the tale of the old man I was moved to my inmost  heart , and I scarce knew what to say .   But now this long while fear was  dead in me , so I thought I would tell the very sooth : but I said first :  ' Sir , what I will tell , I will tell without beseeching , so I pray thee  stand up . '   So did he , and I said : ' Geoffrey , what became of the white  hind after the banners had left the wildwood ' ? He stared wild at me ,  and I deemed that tears began to come into his eyes ; but I said again :  ' What betid to dame Joyce 's youngest born , the fair little maiden that  we left sick of a fever when we rode to

All white and green and blue the vista was , and of a  monastic tranquillity , save for the plashing of the fountain behind the  yew - hedge . From the gardens at his feet irresolute gusts brought tepid  woodland odors . He heard the rustling of papers , heard Lord Brudenel 's  sword fall jangling to the ground . The Duke turned .

"	" Sudden and magnificent , the sun ’s broad golden disc showed itself over  the horizon facing them ; and the first rays , shooting across the level  water - meadows , took the animals full in the eyes and dazzled them . When  they were able to look once more , the Vision had vanished , and the air  was full of the carol of birds that hailed the dawn .  As they stared blankly in dumb misery deepening as they slowly realised  all they had seen and all they had lost , a capricious little breeze ,  dancing up from the surface of the water , tossed the aspens , shook the  dewy roses and blew lightly and caressingly in their faces ; and with  its soft touch came instant oblivion . For this is the last best gift  that the kindly demi - god is careful to bestow on those to whom he has  revealed himself in their helping : the gift of forgetfulness . Lest the  awful remembrance should remain and grow , and overshadow mirth and  pleasure , and the great haunting memory should spoil all the  after - lives of little animals helped out of difficulties , in order that  they should be happy and lighthearted as before .  Mole rubbed his eyes and stared at Rat , who was looking about him in a  puzzled sort of way . “ I beg your pardon ; what did you say , Rat ? ” he  asked .  “ I think I was only remarking , ” said Rat slowly , “ that this was the  right sort of place , and that here , if anywhere , we should find him .  And look ! Why , there he is , the little fellow ! ” And with a cry of  delight he ran towards the slumbering Portly .  But Mole stood still a moment , held in thought .

"	" Now it may be thought upon with wonder , that I did go so assuredly to  the North ; but I went thiswise , part by an inward Knowing , and part come  upon by much latter studying , within the Pyramid , of olden books ; and by  reasoning upon all things that I did observe , that had seemings of  verity in them .  And because of this constant searching upon one matter , I had come , but  a while back , upon a little book of metal , very strange and ancient ,  that had lain forgot in a hid place in the Great Library through ten  hundred thousand years , maybe , or less or more , for all that I had  knowing .  And much that was writ in the book was common knowledge , and set mostly  to the count of fairy - tales and suchlike , even as we of this our age  take not over - surely any belief in Myths of olden times . Yet had I  always much liking for such matters , perceiving behind that outer shell  which did win always so much unbelief , the kernel of ancient truths and  happenings .  And thus was it , concerning this little book which I had made discovery  of ; for it told again , that which oft I had heard ( even as we in this  age , read of the Deluge ) how that once , in a time monstrous far back  from that , but utter future to this age of ours , the world did brake  upwards in a vast earth - quaking , that did rend the world for a thousand  miles .  And there came a mighty chasm , so deep that none might see the bottom  thereof ; and there rushed therein an ocean , and the earth did burst  afresh with a sound that did shake all the cities of the world ; and a  great mist lay upon the earth for many days , and there was a mighty  rain .  And , indeed , this was just so set in certain Histories of the Ancient  World . Also , there was made reference to it , within some olden Records .  Yet nowise to be taken with a serious mind , to the seeming of the  peoples of the Mighty Pyramid ; but only as a quaint study for the  Students , and to be set out in little tales that did entertain the  nurseries ; or , as it might be , wise men and the general .

So each put on the other fellow 's clothes , and Robin  gave the honest Cobbler ten bright new shillings .   Quoth merry Robin , "" I  ha ' been a many things in my life before , but never have I been an  honest cobbler .   Come , friend , let us fall to and eat , for something  within me cackles aloud for that good fat capon .

Then Robin stretched his legs out with a sweet feeling of comfort within  him .

One dark - faced man was  struck with a bullet and was hurt . He saw the child laughing at him and  his heart was full of revenge . So that night , when all had gone to bed ,  the old dark - faced man went softly in the house and got the little girl  and set the house on fire . And he carried her out in the mountains , and  is that worth a quarter ? ""  "" Good heavens , no ! "" said Anne . "" How dare you leave us in such harrowing  suspense ?

So she walked along for about an hour and came to a little village , and  after a few minutes she came to a large rock , and guess who she met ? She  met her father , and when he saw her he hugged her so hard that when he  got through she did not have any breath left in her . And they walked  along , and after a while they came to the wood , and it was now about six  o'clock , and it was very dark , and just then nine robbers jumped out  from behind the trees , and they took a pistol and shot Rachel 's father ,  and the child fainted . Her papa was dead , so she dug a hole and buried  him , and went right back home . And of course that was all , and if I had  that snake , I would n't try to scare you with it , father , anyhow .

"	"And Rodriguez taking the other way  saw at once the towers of Lowlight .  Does my reader think that he then set spurs to his horse , galloping  towards that house about whose balcony his dreams flew every night ? No ,  it was far from evening ; far yet from the colour and calm in which the  light with never a whisper says farewell to Earth , but with a gesture  that the horizon hides takes silent leave of the fields on which she  has danced with joy ; far yet from the hour that shone for Serafina like  a great halo round her and round her mother 's house .  We can not believe that one hour more than another shone upon Serafina ,  or that the dim end of the evening was only hers : but these are the  Chronicles of Rodriguez , who of all the things that befell him  treasured most his memory of Serafina in the twilight , and who held  that this hour was hers as much as her raiment and her balcony : such  therefore it is in these chronicles .  And so he loitered , waiting for the slow sun to set : and when at last a  tint on the walls of Lowlight came with the magic of Earth 's most faery  hour he rode in slowly not perhaps wholly unwitting , for all his  anxious thoughts of Serafina , that a little air of romance from the  Spring and the evening followed this lonely rider .  From some way off he saw that balcony that had drawn him back from the  other side of the far Pyrenees . Sometimes he knew that it drew him and  mostly he knew it not ; yet always that curved balcony brought him  nearer , ever since he turned from the field of the false Don Alvidar :  the balcony held him with invisible threads , such as those with which  Earth draws in the birds at evening . And there was Serafina in her  balcony .  When Rodriguez saw Serafina sitting there in the twilight , just as he  had often dreamed , he looked no more but lowered his head to the  withered rose that he carried now in his hand , the rose that he had  found by that very balcony under another moon . And , gazing still at the  rose , he rode on under the balcony , and passed it , until his hoof - beats  were heard no more in Lowlight and he and his horse were one dim shape  between the night and the twilight . And still he held on .  He knew not yet , but only guessed , who had thrown that rose from the  balcony on

So now stood three of these wains aforesaid belated amidst of the  habitations of the House , their yoke - beasts standing or lying down  unharnessed as yet to them : but in the very midst of that place was a  wain unlike to them ; smaller than they but higher ; square of shape as to  the floor of it ; built lighter than they , yet far stronger ; as the  warrior is stronger than the big carle and trencher - licker that loiters  about the hall ; and from the midst of this wain arose a mast made of a  tall straight fir - tree , and thereon hung the banner of the Wolfings ,  wherein was wrought the image of the Wolf , but red of hue as a token of  war , and with his mouth open and gaping upon the foemen .   Also whereas  the other wains were drawn by mere oxen , and those of divers colours , as  chance would have it , the wain of the banner was drawn by ten black bulls  of the mightiest of the herd , deep - dewlapped , high - crested and  curly - browed ; and their harness was decked with gold , and so was the wain  itself , and the woodwork of it painted red with vermilion .   There then  stood the Banner of the House of the Wolfings awaiting the departure of  the warriors to the hosting .  So Thiodolf stood on the top of the bent beside that same mound wherefrom  he had blown the War - horn yester - eve , and which was called the Hill of  Speech , and he

Even if , deep in my        heart , I thought we were all blind atoms in a world as limited as        a stroke of a pendulum , I and my sort would struggle against        tradition ; try , at least , to displace old cants with new ones .

On it the poor Bunniah sat , and as the soft cotton gave way under him ,  he found himself in the hole , over which the thief carefully placed  a great stone and left him , while he quietly pocketed the ruby .  As the Bunniah did not return to his home for many days , his  daughter - in - law called her husband , and gave him the second ruby .

Finding that neither husband nor father returned , the woman sold her  jewels , and bought clothes and food for the rest of the family ; but for  herself she secretly bought the outfit of a policeman , or chowkidar ,  and resolved to work in that capacity .

""  [ Sidenote : Sir Launcelot arranges the order of battle with King  Bagdemagus ] After this they fell into discourse as to the manner in which  they should do battle upon the morrow , and Sir Launcelot advised in this  wise : "" Lord , let me take three knights of yours , such as you trust , and  such as you hold to be the strongest knights of your party . Let these three  knights paint their shields altogether white and I will paint mine white ,  and then no man will know who we are . For I would have it so that I should  not be known to be in this battle until I shall have approved myself in it .  Now , when you have chosen those three knights , we four will take hiding in  some wood or glade nigh to the place of combat , and when you are most  busily engaged , and when you begin to be hard - pressed , then we will come  forth and fall upon the flank of the party of the King of North Wales with  intent to throw them into confusion . Then you will push your assault very  hard , and I doubt not by the grace of God that we shall betwixt us be able  to bear back their array in confusion . ""  This advice seemed very good to King Bagdemagus , and so he did as Sir  Launcelot said . He chose him three very strong , worthy , honorable knights ,  and these made their shields white as Sir Launcelot directed .  Thus , all things being arranged as Sir Launcelot willed , it came to be the  eve before the battle . So a little after sunset Sir Launcelot and those  three knights whom King Bagdemagus had chosen rode over toward the place of  tourney ( which was some twelve miles from the abbey where the damsel  Elouise was lodged ) . There they found a little woodland of tall , leafy  trees fit for Sir Launcelot 's purpose , and that wood stood to one side of  the meadow of battle and at about the distance of three furlongs from it .  In this little wood Sir Launcelot and the three knights - companion whom King  Bagdemagus had chosen laid themselves down upon the ground and wrapped ,  each man , his cloak about him

You will be a long time in getting to it , if ever you  get to it at all ; but you shall have the loan of my horse , and then you  can ride on it to an old woman who is a neighbor of mine : perhaps she  can tell you about him . When you have got there you must just strike the  horse beneath the left ear and bid it go home again ; but you may take  the golden apple with you . ”  So the girl seated herself on the horse , and rode for a long , long way ,  and at last she came to the mountain , where an aged woman was sitting  outside with a gold carding - comb . The girl asked her if she knew the way  to the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon ; but she  said what the first old woman had said : “ I know nothing about it , but  that it is east of the sun and west of the moon , and that you will be a  long time in getting to it , if ever you get there at all ; but you shall  have the loan of my horse to an old woman who lives the nearest to me :  perhaps she may know where the castle is , and when you have got to her  you may just strike the horse beneath the left ear and bid it go home  again . ” Then she gave her the gold carding - comb , for it might , perhaps ,  be of use to her , she said .

"	"The greater part of those  who speak of him at the inns laud and praise him .  Next day the knights return to arms , alert and strong . From the  array before Oxford rides out a knight of great renown ; Percival  the Welshman , was he called . As soon as Cliges saw him ride forth  and heard the truth as to his name -- for he heard him called  Percival -- he greatly longs to encounter him . Forthwith has he  ridden forth from the rank on a sorrel , Spanish steed ; and his  armour was red . Then they , one and all , regard him with great  wonder , more than they ever did before and say that never before  did they see so comely a knight . And the two prick forward at  once ; for there was no delay . And the one and the other spurs on  so that they give and take mighty blows on their shields . The  lances , which were short and thick , bend and curve . In the sight  of all who were looking on , Cliges has struck Percival , so that  he smites him down from his horse , and makes him give parole  without much fighting , and without great ado . When Percival had  submitted , then they have begun the tourney ; and they all  encounter together . Cliges encounters no knight but he fells him  to the ground . On this day one could not see him a single hour  absent from the fight . Each for himself strikes a blow at Cliges  as though at a tower : not merely two or three strike , for then  that was not the use or custom . Cliges has made an anvil of his  shield ; for all play the smith and hammer upon it and cleave and  quarter it ; but none strikes upon it but Cliges pays him back ,  and throws him from his stirrups and saddle ; and no one , except a  man who wished to lie , could have said on his departure that the  knight with the red shield had not won that whole day . And the  best and most courteous would fain have his acquaintances , but  that can not be so soon ; for he has gone away , secretly , when he  saw that the sun had set ; and he has had his red shield and all  his other armour taken away ; and he has the white arms brought in  which he had been newly knighted ; and the arms and the steed were  placed in front of the door . But now they begin to perceive ( for  the greater part who

"	"Had I paused even momentarily to reflect upon the excellence  of my acting , she would have known . So I resolutely believed I was being  perfectly candid ; and with constant use those older tricks of speech and  gesture and almost of thought , at first laborious mimicry , became  well - nigh involuntary .  In fine , we could not wipe away five years , but with practice we found  that you would very often forget them , and for quite a while ....  I had explained to Bettie 's father I was going to board with them that  summer . Had I not been so haphazard in the progress of this narrative , I  would have earlier announced that Bettie 's father was the Latin  professor at King 's College . He was very old and vague , and his general  attitude toward the universe was that of remote recollection of having  noticed something of the sort before . Professor Hamlyn , therefore , told  me he was glad to hear of my intended stay beneath his roof ; hazarded  the speculation that I had written a book which he meant to read upon  the very first opportunity ; blinked once or twice ; and forthwith lapsed  into consideration of some Pliocene occurrence which , if you were to  judge by the expression of his mild old countenance , he did not find  entirely satisfactory ....  So I spent three months in Fairhaven ; and Bettie and I read all the old  books over again , and were perfectly happy .   7  And what I wrote in those last five chapters of my book was so good that  in common decency I was compelled to alter the preceding twenty - nine and  bring them a bit nearer to Bettie 's standard . For I was utilising  Bettie 's ideas . She did not have the knack of putting them on paper ;  that was my trivial part , as I now recognised with a sort of scared  reverence .  "" Of course , though , you had to meddle , "" I would scold at her . "" I had  meant the infernal thing to be a salable book .

Bless  you , Teddy , bless you ! ”  Jo had backed into a corner , and as she finished her speech , she  vanished precipitately into the kitchen , where she sat down upon a  dresser and told the assembled cats that she was “ happy , oh , so happy ! ”  while Laurie departed , feeling that he had made a rather neat thing of  it .  “ That ’s the interferingest chap I ever see , but I forgive him and do  hope Mrs. March is coming right away , ” said Hannah , with an air of  relief , when Jo told the good news .  Meg had a quiet rapture , and then brooded over the letter , while Jo set  the sickroom in order , and Hannah “ knocked up a couple of pies in case  of company unexpected ” . A breath of fresh air seemed to blow through  the house , and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet  rooms . Everything appeared to feel the hopeful change . Beth ’s bird  began to chirp again , and a half - blown rose was discovered on Amy ’s  bush in the window . The fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness ,  and every time the girls met , their pale faces broke into smiles as  they hugged one another , whispering encouragingly , “ Mother ’s coming ,  dear ! Mother ’s coming ! ” Every one rejoiced but Beth . She lay in that  heavy stupor , alike unconscious of hope and joy , doubt and danger . It  was a piteous sight , the once rosy face so changed and vacant , the once  busy hands so weak and wasted , the once smiling lips quite dumb , and  the once pretty , well - kept hair scattered rough and tangled on the  pillow . All day she lay so , only rousing now and then to mutter ,  “ Water ! ” with lips so parched they could hardly shape the word . All day  Jo and Meg hovered over her , watching , waiting , hoping , and trusting in  God and Mother , and all day the snow fell , the bitter wind raged , and  the hours dragged slowly

"	"But ,  indeed , I took no heed , only that I was like to shake her ; and did know  also that her hair did be wondrous pretty upon mine armour . And she soon  to lie very quiet and easy in mine arms , and to be demure .  And I to have a half knowledge of somewhat amiss ; but yet to have no  sureness , neither to think much upon this vague feeling .  And when that I had gone a good mile , she to put up her lips to be kist ;  and I to kiss her very loving , for she was so dear . And she then to say ,  very ordinary like , that I should do wisely now if that I went back for  her foot - gear , which truly I had lacked thought to notice , when that I  did pick up the Maid .  And I saw that she had known this thing all that while , and had made  that mile of carrying all a waste and a foolishness , because of the  naughty rebellion which did be in her . And lo ! I set her instant to the  ground ; and she gave out a little cry as she saw that I did be gone  somewise hard and stern with her .  And indeed I pulled a small branch from a tree that did be near , to be  for a switch as you shall whip a boy with ; and I held her with my left  hand , and in verity I laid the switch thrice very sharp across her  pretty shoulders , that she know all that she did need to know . And she  seeming to be ceased in a moment from her perverseness , and did nestle  very quick unto me , that had whipt her ; and did need that she be  wondrous nigh unto me . And , truly , how shall even a young man flog such  an one .  And the Maid to be very husht against mine armour , and to resist that I  look into her face that did be prest so anigh me . But presently , I used  a little and gentle force , and so to look into her face something  sudden . And truly , that One did be smiling very naughty and dainty to  herself ; so that I perceived that I had not truly whipt her enough ; but  yet I could harden my heart no more at that time ; for , in verity , there  doth be a strange half - pain in the bosom , if that you have to flog a  maid that doth be utter thine , and this to the despite

"<fantasy>  At the upper end of the hall was a raised dais , upon which stood  a throne covered with crimson satin and embroidered with lions and  flower - deluces ; it was the King 's seat .
"	"He and his personal attendants  had not yet come , but the rest of the company were gathered . The day  being warm and sultry , the balcony was all aflutter with the feather  fans of the ladies of the family and their attendants , who from this  high place looked down upon the hall below . Up the centre of the hall  was laid a carpet of arras , and the passage was protected by wooden  railings . Upon the one side were tiers of seats for the castle  gentlefolks and the guests . Upon the other stood the burghers from the  town , clad in sober dun and russet , and yeomanry in green and brown . The  whole of the great vaulted hall was full of the dull hum of many people  waiting , and a ceaseless restlessness stirred the crowded throng . But  at last a whisper went around that the King was coming . A momentary hush  fell , and through it was heard the noisy clatter of horses ' feet coming  nearer and nearer , and then stopping before the door . The sudden blare  of trumpets broke through the hush ; another pause , and then in through  the great door - way of the hall came the royal procession .  First of all marched , in the order of their rank , and to the number of  a score or more , certain gentlemen , esquires and knights , chosen mostly  from the King 's attendants . Behind these came two pursuivants - at - arms  in tabards , and following them a party of a dozen more bannerets  and barons . Behind these again , a little space intervening , came two  heralds , also in tabards , a group of the greater nobles attendant  upon the King following in the order of their rank . Next came the  King - at - arms and , at a little distance and walking with sober slowness ,  the King himself , with the Earl and the Count directly attendant upon  him -- the one marching upon the right hand and the other upon the left .  A breathless silence filled the whole space as the royal procession  advanced slowly up the hall . Through the stillness could be heard the  muffled sound of the footsteps on the carpet , the dry rustling of  silk and satin garments , and the clear clink and jingle of chains and  jewelled ornaments , but not the sound of a single voice .  After the moment or two of bustle and confusion of the King taking his  place had passed , another little space of expectant silence fell . At  last there suddenly came the noise of acclamation of those who stood

"<fairy> Now therefore on the  Wednesday , the peasant woman took to her bed , and complained and  lamented as agreed on , and her husband did everything for her that he  could think of , but nothing did her any good , and when Sunday came the  woman said , “ I feel as ill as if I were going to die at once , but there  is one thing I should like to do before my end I should like to hear  the parson ’s sermon that he is going to preach to - day .
"	"” On that the  peasant said , “ Ah , my child , do not do it — thou mightest make thyself  worse if thou wert to get up . Look , I will go to the sermon , and will  attend to it very carefully , and will tell thee everything the parson  says . ”  “ Well , ” said the woman , “ go , then , and pay great attention , and repeat  to me all that thou hearest . ” So the peasant went to the sermon , and  the parson began to preach and said , if any one had at home a sick  child , a sick husband , a sick wife , a sick father a sick mother , a sick  sister , brother or any one else , and would make a pilgrimage to the  Göckerli hill in Italy , where a peck of laurel - leaves costs a kreuzer ,  the sick child , sick husband , sick wife , sick father , sick mother , sick  sister , brother , or whosoever else it might be , would be restored to  health instantly , and whosoever wished to undertake the journey was to  go to him after the service was over , and he would give him the sack  for the laurel - leaves and the kreuzer .  Then no one was more rejoiced than the peasant , and after the service  was over , he went at once to the parson , who gave him the bag for the  laurel - leaves and the kreuzer . After that he went home , and even at the  house door he cried , “ Hurrah ! dear wife , it is now almost the same  thing as if thou wert well ! The parson has preached to - day that  whosoever had at home a sick child , a sick husband , a sick wife , a sick  father , a sick mother , a sick sister , brother or whoever it might be ,  and would make a pilgrimage to the Göckerli hill in Italy , where a peck  of laurel - leaves costs a kreuzer , the sick child , sick husband , sick  wife , sick father , sick mother , sick sister , brother , or whosoever else  it was , would be cured immediately , and now I have already got the bag  and the kreuzer from the parson , and will at once begin my journey so  that thou mayst get well the faster , ” and thereupon he went away . He  was , however , hardly gone before the woman got up , and the parson was  there directly .  But now we will leave these two for a while ,

And it did be sudden to my quickened fancy , that there did be low echoes  all about us , of the voices of dear beautiful ones that have died ; for  so did memory set a strange and lovely mystery about my spirit in that  moment , that I did be all shaken so much as Mine Own . And I to be as  that I drew my breath anigh to tears , and did be there with Naani amid  the quiet spareness of the trees and the rock of that part of the land ;  but yet did be to see half dimly that I stood within a light , even as  the light that doth be the wonder of olden sunsets ; and I to be , in the  same time , both _ that _ man and _ this _ man that now doth write ; and to  have beside my spirit but one maid , that I did lack to know whether I  say to her Naani or Mirdath ; for though the two that have been Mine Own  did be different - seeming to the eye , there to be but the spirit of one  maid beside me in that moment .  And surely , I did be there , all shaken unto the seeing of visions , as it  did seem ; so that the Land about me to have grown half as that it did  lack that it be real unto my sight , because that I lookt inward unto  Lands that did be of Memory .

And the boatswain came again and took off his cap  and asked Captain Shard to be so kind as to tell them about his new  course . Shard said he meant to stay until they had eaten three more of  the oxen as they could only take three of them in the hold , there were  only six left now . But what if there was no wind , the boatswain said .  And at that moment the faintest breeze from the North ruffled the  boatswain 's forelock as he stood with his cap in his hand .  "" Do n't talk about the wind to _ me _ , "" said Captain Shard : and Bill was  a little frightened for Shard 's mother had been a gipsy .  But it was only a breeze astray , a trick of the Sahara .

"	"The advice of all these agitated ladies was that the prince  should go at once and knock at Rogojin ’s until he was let in : and when  let in insist upon a substantial explanation of everything . If Rogojin  was really not at home , the prince was advised to go to a certain  house , the address of which was given , where lived a German lady , a  friend of Nastasia Philipovna ’s . It was possible that she might have  spent the night there in her anxiety to conceal herself .  The prince rose from his seat in a condition of mental collapse . The  good ladies reported afterwards that “ his pallor was terrible to see ,  and his legs seemed to give way underneath him . ” With difficulty he was  made to understand that his new friends would be glad of his address ,  in order to act with him if possible . After a moment ’s thought he gave  the address of the small hotel , on the stairs of which he had had a fit  some five weeks since . He then set off once more for Rogojin ’s .  This time they neither opened the door at Rogojin ’s flat nor at the one  opposite . The prince found the porter with difficulty , but when found ,  the man would hardly look at him or answer his questions , pretending to  be busy . Eventually , however , he was persuaded to reply so far as to  state that Rogojin had left the house early in the morning and gone to  Pavlofsk , and that he would not return today at all .  “ I shall wait ; he may come back this evening . ”  “ He may not be home for a week . ”  “ Then , at all events , he _ did _ sleep here , did he ? ”  “ Well — he did sleep here , yes . ”  All this was suspicious and unsatisfactory . Very likely the porter had  received new instructions during the interval of the prince ’s absence ;  his manner was so different now . He had been obliging — now he was as  obstinate and silent as a mule . However , the prince decided to call  again in a couple of hours , and after that to watch the house , in case  of need . His hope was that he might yet find Nastasia at the address  which he had just received . To that address he now set off at full  speed .  But alas ! at the German lady ’s house they did not even appear to  understand what he wanted . After a while , by means of

'  "" So I sat down by her , and in spite of her word I told her all that had  befallen betwixt me and the king 's son :   for my heart was too full that  I might refrain me .   She nodded her head from time to time , but said  naught , till I had made an end :   and then fell to telling me of many  matters for my avail ; but yet arose earlier than her wo nt was ; and when  we were about sundering on the path which I had trodden above the Dale ,  she said : ' Now must I give thee that gift to go along with the gift of  the lover , the King 's son ; and I think thou wilt find it of avail  before many days are gone by . '   Therewith she took from her pouch a  strong sharp knife , and drew it from the sheath , and flashed it in the  afternoon sun , and gave it to me ; and I took it and laid it in my bosom  and thanked her ; for I thought that I understood her meaning , and how  it would avail me .   Then I went driving my goats home speedily , so that  the sun was barely set when I came to the garth ; and a great horror  rather than a fear of my mistress was on me ; and lo ! she stood in the  door of the house gazing down the garth and the woodland beyond , as  though she were looking for my coming : and when her eyes lighted on me ,  she scowled , and drew her lips back from her teeth and clenched her  hands with fury , though there was nought in them ; and she was a tall  and strong woman , though now growing somewhat old : but as for me , I had  unsheathed the carline 's gift before I came to the garth , and now I  held it behind my back in my left hand .

And  suddenly there at his hooves in the dark of the plain appeared the  cleft in the legendary lands , and Zretazoola sheltering in the cleft ,  and sunning herself in the evening .  Swiftly and craftily he bounded down by the upper end of the cleft ,  and entering Zretazoola by the outer gate which looks out sheer on the  stars , he galloped suddenly down the narrow streets . Many that rushed  out on to balconies as he went clattering by , many that put their  heads from glittering windows , are told of in olden song . Shepperalk  did not tarry to give greetings or to answer challenges from martial  towers , he was down through the earthward gateway like the thunderbolt  of his sires , and , like Leviathan who has leapt at an eagle , he surged  into the water between temple and tomb .  He galloped with half - shut eyes up the temple - steps , and , only seeing  dimly through his lashes , seized Sombelenë by the hair , undazzled as  yet by her beauty , and so haled her away ; and , leaping with her over  the floorless chasm where the waters of the lake fall unremembered  away into a hole in the world , took her we know not where , to be her  slave for all centuries that are allowed to his race .  Three blasts he gave as he went upon that silver horn that is the  world - old treasure of the centaurs . These were his wedding bells .

A thief was he , of very high repute , being  patronized by the lofty and elect , for he stole nothing smaller than  the Moomoo 's egg , and in all his life stole only four kinds of  stone -- the ruby , the diamond , the emerald , and the sapphire ; and , as  jewellers go , his honesty was great . Now there was a Merchant Prince  who had come to Thangobrind and had offered his daughter 's soul for  the diamond that is larger than the human head and was to be found on  the lap of the spider - idol , Hlo - hlo , in his temple of Moung - ga - ling ;  for he had heard that Thangobrind was a thief to be trusted .

"<fairy> Go , Badger , order the Banquet , order what you like ; then  join our young friends outside in their innocent mirth , oblivious of me  and my cares and toils .
"	"I sacrifice this fair morning on the altar of  duty and friendship ! ”  The Badger looked at him very suspiciously , but Toad ’s frank , open  countenance made it difficult to suggest any unworthy motive in this  change of attitude . He quitted the room , accordingly , in the direction  of the kitchen , and as soon as the door had closed behind him , Toad  hurried to the writing - table . A fine idea had occurred to him while he  was talking . He _ would _ write the invitations ; and he would take care  to mention the leading part he had taken in the fight , and how he had  laid the Chief Weasel flat ; and he would hint at his adventures , and  what a career of triumph he had to tell about ; and on the fly - leaf he  would set out a sort of a programme of entertainment for the  evening — something like this , as he sketched it out in his head : —  SPEECH . . . . BY TOAD .  ( There will be other speeches by TOAD during the evening . )  ADDRESS . . . BY TOAD  SYNOPSIS — Our Prison System — the Waterways of Old England — Horse - dealing ,  and how to deal — Property , its rights and its duties — Back to the Land — A  Typical English Squire .  SONG . . . . BY TOAD .  ( Composed by himself . )  OTHER COMPOSITIONS . BY TOAD  will be sung in the course of the evening by the . . . COMPOSER .  The idea pleased him mightily , and he worked very hard and got all the  letters finished by noon , at which hour it was reported to him that  there was a small and rather bedraggled weasel at the door , inquiring  timidly whether he could be of any service to the gentlemen . Toad  swaggered out and found it was one of the prisoners of the previous  evening , very respectful and anxious to please . He patted him on the  head , shoved the bundle of invitations into his paw , and told him to  cut along quick and deliver them as fast as he could , and if he liked  to come back again in the evening , perhaps there might be a shilling  for him , or , again , perhaps there might n’t ; and the poor weasel seemed  really quite grateful , and hurried off eagerly to do his mission .  When the other animals came back to luncheon , very boisterous and  breezy after a morning on the river , the Mole , whose conscience had  been pricking

But she had  promised to hear him , and her curiosity no less than her honor was  engaged . After a moment ’s recollection , therefore , concluding that  prudence required dispatch , and that her acquiescence would best  promote it , she walked silently towards the table , and sat down . He  took the opposite chair , and for half a minute not a word was said by  either .  “ Pray be quick , sir,”—said Elinor , impatiently;—“I have no time to  spare . ”  He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation , and seemed not to  hear her .  “ Your sister , ” said he , with abruptness , a moment afterwards—“is out of  danger . I heard it from the servant . God be praised!—But is it true ? is  it really true ? ”  Elinor would not speak . He repeated the inquiry with yet greater  eagerness .  “ For God ’s sake tell me , is she out of danger , or is she not ? ”  “ We hope she is . ”  He rose up , and walked across the room .  “ Had I known as much half an hour ago;—but since I _ am _ here , ” speaking  with a forced vivacity as he returned to his seat,—“what does it  signify ? For once , Miss Dashwood — it will be the last time , perhaps — let  us be cheerful together . I am in a fine mood for gaiety . Tell me  honestly ” a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks , “ do you think me most  a knave or a fool ? ”  Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever . She began to  think that he must be in liquor;—the strangeness of such a visit , and  of such manners , seemed no otherwise intelligible ; and with this  impression she immediately rose , saying ,  “ Mr. Willoughby , I advise you at present to return to Combe . I am not  at leisure to remain with you longer . Whatever your business may be  with me , it will be better recollected and explained to - morrow . ”  “ I understand you , ” he replied , with an expressive smile , and a voice  perfectly calm ; “ yes , I am very drunk .

"	" It was a detached house , and the night was dark as pitch when Sikes and  Crackit , dragging Oliver along , climbed the wall and approached a  narrow , shuttered window . In vain Oliver implored them to let him go .  "" Listen , you young limb , "" whispered Sikes , when a crowbar had overcome  the shutter , and the lattice had been opened . "" I 'm going to put you  through there . "" Drawing a dark lantern from his pocket , he added , "" Take  this light ; go softly up the steps straight afore you , and along the  hall to the street door ; unfasten it , and let us in .

Hardly had Oliver advanced a few yards before Sikes called out , "" Back !  back ! ""  Startled , the boy dropped the lantern , uncertain whether to advance or  fly .  The cry was repeated -- a light appeared -- a vision of two terrified ,  half - dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyes -- a  flash -- a loud noise -- and he staggered back .  Sikes got him out of the window before the smoke cleared away , and fired  his pistol after the men , who were already in retreat .  "" Clasp your arm tighter , "" said Sikes .

Sikes , finding the chase too hot , was compelled to leave Oliver in a  ditch and make his escape with his friend Crackit .  It was morning when Oliver awoke .

"<fairy>  This household happiness did not come all at once , but John and Meg had  found the key to it , and each year of married life taught them how to  use it , unlocking the treasuries of real home love and mutual  helpfulness , which the poorest may possess , and the richest can not buy .
"	" This is the sort of shelf on which young wives and mothers may consent  to be laid , safe from the restless fret and fever of the world , finding  loyal lovers in the little sons and daughters who cling to them ,  undaunted by sorrow , poverty , or age , walking side by side , through  fair and stormy weather , with a faithful friend , who is , in the true  sense of the good old Saxon word , the ‘ house - band ’ , and learning , as  Meg learned , that a woman ’s happiest kingdom is home , her highest honor  the art of ruling it not as a queen , but as a wise wife and mother .  CHAPTER THIRTY - NINE  LAZY LAURENCE  Laurie went to Nice intending to stay a week , and remained a month . He  was tired of wandering about alone , and Amy ’s familiar presence seemed  to give a homelike charm to the foreign scenes in which she bore a  part . He rather missed the ‘ petting ’ he used to receive , and enjoyed a  taste of it again , for no attentions , however flattering , from  strangers , were half so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls  at home . Amy never would pet him like the others , but she was very glad  to see him now , and quite clung to him , feeling that he was the  representative of the dear family for whom she longed more than she  would confess . They naturally took comfort in each other ’s society and  were much together , riding , walking , dancing , or dawdling , for at Nice  no one can be very industrious during the gay season . But , while  apparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion , they were  half - consciously making discoveries and forming opinions about each  other . Amy rose daily in the estimation of her friend , but he sank in  hers , and each felt the truth before a word was spoken . Amy tried to  please , and succeeded , for she was grateful for the many pleasures he  gave her , and repaid him with the little services to which womanly  women know how to lend an indescribable charm . Laurie made no effort of  any kind , but just let himself drift along as comfortably as possible ,  trying to forget , and feeling that all women owed him a kind word  because one had been cold to him . It cost him no effort to be generous ,  and he would have given Amy all the trinkets in Nice if she would have  taken them , but at the

"	"I know that once when your sister  Adelaida saw my portrait she said that such beauty could overthrow the  world . But I have renounced the world . You think it strange that I  should say so , for you saw me decked with lace and diamonds , in the  company of drunkards and wastrels . Take no notice of that ; I know that  I have almost ceased to exist . God knows what it is dwelling within me  now — it is not myself . I can see it every day in two dreadful eyes which  are always looking at me , even when not present . These eyes are silent  now , they say nothing ; but I know their secret . His house is gloomy ,  and there is a secret in it . I am convinced that in some box he has a  razor hidden , tied round with silk , just like the one that Moscow  murderer had . This man also lived with his mother , and had a razor  hidden away , tied round with white silk , and with this razor he  intended to cut a throat .  “ All the while I was in their house I felt sure that somewhere beneath  the floor there was hidden away some dreadful corpse , wrapped in  oil - cloth , perhaps buried there by his father , who knows ? Just as in  the Moscow case . I could have shown you the very spot !  “ He is always silent , but I know well that he loves me so much that he  must hate me . My wedding and yours are to be on the same day ; so I have  arranged with him . I have no secrets from him . I would kill him from  very fright , but he will kill me first . He has just burst out laughing ,  and says that I am raving . He knows I am writing to you . ”  There was much more of this delirious wandering in the letters — one of  them was very long .  At last the prince came out of the dark , gloomy park , in which he had  wandered about for hours just as yesterday . The bright night seemed to  him to be lighter than ever . “ It must be quite early , ” he thought . ( He  had forgotten his watch . ) There was a sound of distant music somewhere .  “ Ah , ” he thought , “ the Vauxhall ! They wo n’t be there today , of course ! ”  At this moment he noticed that he was close to their house ; he had felt  that he must gravitate to this spot

"	"And so ,  for a space of wonder , I had speech with that girl out in the darkness  of the world , who had knowledge of my name , and of the old - earth  love - name , and named herself Mirdath .  And much I questioned her , and presently to my sorrow ; for it seemed  that her name was not truly Mirdath ; but Naani ; neither had she known my  name ; but that in the library of that place where she abode , there had  been a story of one named by my name , and called by that sweet love - name  which she had sent out somewhat ruthless into the night ; and the girl 's  name had been Mirdath ; and when first she , Naani had called , there had  come back to her a cry of Mirdath , Mirdath ; and this had minded her so  strangely of that olden story which had stayed in her memory ; that she  had answered as the maid in that book might have answered .  And thus did it seem that the utter Romance of my Memory - love had  vanished , and I stood strangely troubled for sorrow of a love of olden  times . Yet , even then I marvelled that any book should have story so  much like to mine ; not heeding that the history of all love is writ with  one pen .  Yet , even then in that hour of my strange , and quaintly foolish pain ,  there came a thing that set me thrilling ; though more afterwards , when I  came to think afresh upon it . For the girl who spoke to me through the  night made some wonder that my voice were not deeper ; yet in quiet  fashion , and as one who says a thing , scarce wotting what they say . But  even to me then , there came a sudden hope ; for in the olden days of this  Present Age my voice had been very deep . And I said to her that maybe  the man in the book was said to have had a deep tone of speech ; but she ,  seeming puzzled , said nay ; and at that I questioned her the more ; but  only to the trouble of her memory and understanding .  And strange must it seem that we two should talk on so trivial a matter ,  when there was so much else that we had need to exchange thought upon ;  for were a man in this present day to have speech with those who may  live within that red planet of Mars within the sky , scarce could the  wonder of it exceed

The three soldiers wandered about for a  minute or two , looking for them , and then quietly marched off after the  others .  “ Are their heads off ? ” shouted the Queen .  “ Their heads are gone , if it please your Majesty ! ” the soldiers shouted  in reply .  “ That ’s right ! ” shouted the Queen . “ Can you play croquet ? ”  The soldiers were silent , and looked at Alice , as the question was  evidently meant for her .  “ Yes ! ” shouted Alice .  “ Come on , then ! ” roared the Queen , and Alice joined the procession ,  wondering very much what would happen next .  “ It’s — it ’s a very fine day ! ” said a timid voice at her side . She was  walking by the White Rabbit , who was peeping anxiously into her face .  “ Very , ” said Alice : “ — where ’s the Duchess ? ”  “ Hush ! Hush ! ” said the Rabbit in a low , hurried tone . He looked  anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke , and then raised himself upon  tiptoe , put his mouth close to her ear , and whispered “ She ’s under  sentence of execution . ”  “ What for ? ” said Alice .  “ Did you say ‘ What a pity ! ’ ? ” the Rabbit asked .  “ No , I did n’t , ” said Alice : “ I do n’t think it ’s at all a pity .

The first day ’s journey was through the green fields and bright flowers  that stretched about the Emerald City on every side . They slept that  night on the grass , with nothing but the stars over them ; and they  rested very well indeed .  In the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood . There  was no way of going around it , for it seemed to extend to the right and  left as far as they could see ; and , besides , they did not dare change  the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost . So they looked  for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest .  The Scarecrow , who was in the lead , finally discovered a big tree with  such wide - spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass  underneath . So he walked forward to the tree , but just as he came under  the first branches they bent down and twined around him , and the next  minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his  fellow travelers .

"<fantasy> PROLOGUE  Giving an account of Robin Hood and his adventure with the King 's  Foresters .
"	"Also telling how his band gathered around him , and of the  merry adventure that gained him his good right hand man , the famous  Little John .  How Robin Hood Came to Be an Outlaw  IN MERRY ENGLAND in the time of old , when good King Henry the Second  ruled the land , there lived within the green glades of Sherwood Forest ,  near Nottingham Town , a famous outlaw whose name was Robin Hood .   No  archer ever lived that could speed a gray goose shaft with such skill  and cunning as his , nor were there ever such yeomen as the sevenscore  merry men that roamed with him through the greenwood shades . Right  merrily they dwelled within the depths of Sherwood Forest , suffering  neither care nor want , but passing the time in merry games of archery or  bouts of cudgel play , living upon the King 's venison , washed down with  draughts of ale of October brewing .  Not only Robin himself but all the band were outlaws and dwelled apart  from other men , yet they were beloved by the country people round about ,  for no one ever came to jolly Robin for help in time of need and went  away again with an empty fist .  And now I will tell how it came about that Robin Hood fell afoul of the  law .  When Robin was a youth of eighteen , stout of sinew and bold of heart ,  the Sheriff of Nottingham proclaimed a shooting match and offered a  prize of a butt of ale to whosoever should shoot the best shaft in  Nottinghamshire .   "" Now , "" quoth Robin , "" will I go too , for fain would I  draw a string for the bright eyes of my lass and a butt of good October  brewing . "" So up he got and took his good stout yew bow and a score or  more of broad clothyard arrows , and started off from Locksley Town  through Sherwood Forest to Nottingham .  It was at the dawn of day in the merry Maytime , when hedgerows are green  and flowers bedeck the meadows ; daisies pied and yellow cuckoo buds and  fair primroses all along the briery hedges ; when apple buds blossom and  sweet birds sing , the lark at dawn of day , the throstle cock and cuckoo ;  when lads and lasses look upon each other with sweet thoughts ; when busy  housewives spread their linen to bleach upon the bright green grass .  Sweet was the greenwood as he walked along its paths , and bright the  green and rustling leaves , amid which the little birds sang with might  and main :

"	"  Now were the men of the kindreds at  point to climb this twiggen burg ; but by this time the fury of  Face - of - god had run clear , and he knew where he was and what he was  doing ; so he stayed his folk , and cried out to them : ‘ Forbear , climb not !  let the torch help the sword ! ’   And therewith he looked about and saw the  fire - pot which had been set down there for the kindling of the bale - fire ,  and the coals were yet red in it ; so he snatched up a dry brand and  lighted it thereat , and so did divers others , and they thrust them among  the faggots , and the fire caught at once , and the tongues of flame began  to leap from faggot to faggot till all was in a light low ; for the wood  had been laid for that very end , and smeared with grease and oil so that  the burning to the god might be speedy .  But the fierceness of the kindreds heeded not the fire , nor overmuch the  men who leapt down from the stack before it , but they left all behind  them , faring straight toward the western outgate from the Market - stead ;  and Face - of - god still led them on ; though by now he was wholly come to  his right mind again , albeit the burden of sorrow yet lay heavy on his  heart .   He had broken his axe , and had once more drawn Dale - warden from  his sheath , and many felt his point and edge .  But now , as they chased , came a rush of men upon them again , as though a  new onset were at hand .   That saw Face - of - god and Hall - ward and War - well ,  and other wise leaders of men , and they bade their folk forbear the  chase , and lock their ranks to meet the onfall of this new wave of  foemen .   And they did so , and stood fast as a wall ; but lo ! the onrush  that drave up against them was but a fleeing shrieking throng , and no  longer an array of warriors , for many had cast away their weapons , and  were rushing they knew not whither ; for they were being thrust on the  bitter edges of Face - of - god ’s companies by the terror of the fleers from  the onset of the men of the Face , the Sickle , and the Vine , whom  Hall - face and Stone - face were leading ,

That ill - omened bird who stood above the  maiden - flower let him come within a stalk 's length , so near that the  white splendour of his sleeping lady gleamed within arms ' reach , then  the great beak was opened , the great claws made a clutch , the gallant 's  head was yanked from his neck , and as it went tumbling down the maw of  the feathered thing his white legs fell spinning through space , and lay  knotting themselves in agony upon the ground for a minute or two before  they relaxed and became flaccid in the repose of death . Another and  another vegetable suitor made for that fatal tryst , and as each came up  the snap of the brown bird 's beak was all their obsequies . At last no  more came , and then that Nemesis of claws and quills walked over to the  girl - flower , his stomach feathers ruffled with repletion , the green  blood of her lovers dripping from his claws , and pulled her golden  heart out , tore her white limbs one from the other , and swallowed her  piecemeal before my very eyes !   Then up in wrath I jumped and yelled at  him till the woods echoed , but too late to stay his sacrilege .

"	"  “ I purpose not  to leave thee , ” said Gwalchmai , “ till I know who thou art . ”   And he  charged him with his lance , and struck him on his shield , so that the  shaft was shivered into splinters , and their horses were front to front .  Then Gwalchmai gazed fixedly upon him , and he knew him .   “ Ah , Geraint , ”  said he , “ is it thou that art here ? ”   “ I am not Geraint , ” said he .  “ Geraint thou art , by Heaven , ” he replied , “ and a wretched and insane  expedition is this . ”   Then he looked around , and beheld Enid , and he  welcomed her gladly .   “ Geraint , ” said Gwalchmai , “ come thou and see  Arthur ; he is thy lord and thy cousin . ”   “ I will not , ” said he , “ for I am  not in a fit state to go and see any one . ”   Thereupon , behold , one of the  pages came after Gwalchmai to speak to him .   So he sent him to apprise  Arthur that Geraint was there wounded , and that he would not go to visit  him , and that it was pitiable to see the plight that he was in .   And this  he did without Geraint ’s knowledge , inasmuch as he spoke in a whisper to  the page .   “ Entreat Arthur , ” said he , “ to have his tent brought near to  the road , for he will not meet him willingly , and it is not easy to  compel him in the mood he is in . ”   So the page came to Arthur , and told  him this .

"<fairy> He did not care to have Huck ’s company in public  places .
"	"He was gone half an hour . He found that in the best tavern , No .  2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer , and was still so occupied .  In the less ostentatious house , No . 2 was a mystery . The tavern - keeper ’s  young son said it was kept locked all the time , and he never saw anybody  go into it or come out of it except at night ; he did not know any  particular reason for this state of things ; had had some little  curiosity , but it was rather feeble ; had made the most of the mystery  by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was “ ha’nted ” ; had  noticed that there was a light in there the night before .  “ That ’s what I ’ve found out , Huck . I reckon that ’s the very No . 2 we ’re  after . ”  “ I reckon it is , Tom . Now what you going to do ? ”  “ Lemme think . ”  Tom thought a long time . Then he said :  “ I ’ll tell you . The back door of that No . 2 is the door that comes out  into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap  of a brick store . Now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find , and  I ’ll nip all of auntie ’s , and the first dark night we ’ll go there and  try ’em . And mind you , keep a lookout for Injun Joe , because he said he  was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get  his revenge . If you see him , you just follow him ; and if he do n’t go to  that No . 2 , that ai n’t the place . ”  “ Lordy , I do n’t want to foller him by myself ! ”  “ Why , it ’ll be night , sure . He might n’t ever see you — and if he did ,  maybe he ’d never think anything . ”  “ Well , if it ’s pretty dark I reckon I ’ll track him . I dono — I dono . I ’ll  try . ”  “ You bet I ’ll follow him , if it ’s dark , Huck . Why , he might ’ a ’ found  out he could n’t get his revenge , and be going right after that money . ”  “ It ’s so , Tom , it ’s so . I ’ll foller him ; I will , by jingoes ! ”  “ Now you ’re _ talking _ !

I ’d rather die than drink that awful medicine . ”  At that moment , the door of the room flew open and in came four Rabbits  as black as ink , carrying a small black coffin on their shoulders .  “ What do you want from me ? ” asked Pinocchio .  “ We have come for you , ” said the largest Rabbit .  “ For me ? But I ’m not dead yet ! ”  “ No , not dead yet ; but you will be in a few moments since you have  refused to take the medicine which would have made you well . ”  “ Oh , Fairy , my Fairy , ” the Marionette cried out , “ give me that glass !  Quick , please ! I do n’t want to die ! No , no , not yet -- not yet ! ”  And holding the glass with his two hands , he swallowed the medicine at  one gulp .  “ Well , ” said the four Rabbits , “ this time we have made the trip for  nothing . ”  And turning on their heels , they marched solemnly out of the room ,  carrying their little black coffin and muttering and grumbling between  their teeth .  In a twinkling , Pinocchio felt fine . With one leap he was out of bed and  into his clothes .  The Fairy , seeing him run and jump around the room gay as a bird on  wing , said to him :  “ My medicine was good for you , after all , was n’t it ? ”  “ Good indeed ! It has given me new life . ”  “ Why , then , did I have to beg you so hard to make you drink it ? ”  “ I ’m a boy , you see , and all boys hate medicine more than they do  sickness . ”  “ What a shame ! Boys ought to know , after all , that medicine , taken in  time , can save them from much pain and even from death . ”  “ Next time I wo n’t have to be begged so hard .

"	"I have heard old hands say “ That one is  going well over . ” “ Whee - oo , ” says the shell ; but just where the  “ oo ” should be long drawn out and turn into the hyena ’s final  syllable , it says something quite different . “ Zarp , ” it says . That  is bad . Those are the shells that are looking for you .  And then of course there is the whizz - bang coming from close , along  his flat trajectory : he has little to say , but comes like a sudden  wind , and all that he has to do is done and over at once .  And then there is the gas shell , who goes over gurgling gluttonously ,  probably in big herds , putting down a barrage . It is the liquid inside  that gurgles before it is turned to gas by the mild explosion ; that is  the explanation of it ; yet that does not prevent one picturing a tribe  of cannibals who have winded some nice juicy men and are smacking  their chops and dribbling in anticipation .  And a wonderful thing to see , even in those wonderful nights , is our  thermite bursting over the heads of the Germans . The shell breaks into  a shower of golden rain ; one can not judge easily at night how high  from the ground it breaks , but about as high as the tops of trees seen  at a hundred yards . It spreads out evenly all round and rains down  slowly ; it is a bad shower to be out in , and for a long time after it  has fallen , the sodden grass of winter , and the mud and old bones  beneath it , burn quietly in a circle . On such a night as this , and in  such showers , the flying pigs will go over , which take two men to  carry each of them ; they go over and root right down to the German  dugout , where the German has come in out of the golden rain , and they  fling it all up in the air .  These are such nights as Scheherazade with all her versatility never  dreamed of ; or if such nightmares came she certainly never told of  them , or her august master , the Sultan , light of the age , would have  had her at once beheaded ; and his people would have deemed that he did  well . It has been reserved for a modern autocrat to dream such a  nightmare , driven to it perhaps by the tales of a white - whiskered  Scheherazade , the Lord of the Kiel Canal ;

"	"Ozana and Miss Cuttenclip became friends  at once .  Hi - Lo greeted Ozana and the rest joyfully , but it was necessary for him  to make two trips to carry this large party to the mountain top . Ozana  showed the visitors around the Village of Pineville and Story Blossom  Garden . On the surface of the blue pond floated the three swans .  Knowing that Ozana would no longer need them to carry her back to Mount  Illuso , Ozma had thoughtfully transported the swans from the court - yard  of her palace to their pond when she had worked the fairy spell that  had brought the Story Blossom Garden to Oz .  After passing several happy hours in the Story Blossom Garden , Ozana  and her guests returned to the bottom of the mountain , where the  Sawhorse and the Red Wagon waited to carry them back to the Emerald  City .  The rest of the day was devoted to preparing for the Grand Banquet to  be given in Ozana 's honor that evening in the Grand Dining Room of the  Royal Palace . All of Ozma 's old friends and companions were invited .  Late in the afternoon the guests began arriving . The Tin Woodman  journeyed from his glittering Tin Castle in the Winkie Country . Jack  Pumpkinhead left his house , a huge , hollowed - out pumpkin in the middle  of a pumpkin field . The Highly Magnified and Thoroughly Educated Woggle  Bug traveled from the Royal Athletic College of Oz , of which he was  Principal .  Among other guests who came from great distances were Glinda the  Good , the Giant Frogman , Cayke the Cookie Cook , Dr. Pipt -- the Crooked  Magician who was no longer crooked nor a magician , his wife Margolotte ,  the Good Witch of the North and Lady Aurex Queen of the Skeezers .  Dorothy transported all of these visitors to the Emerald City by means  of her Magic Belt , except Glinda , who arrived by her own magic .  The Grand Banquet proved to be one of the most brilliant and delightful  occasions ever to be enjoyed in the Emerald City , and was long  remembered by all who were present . In addition to the delicious food ,  there was music and special entertainment for the guests . The Scarecrow  made a gallant speech of welcome to which Ozana charmingly replied .  The Woggle Bug could not be restrained from reading an "" Ode to Ozana , ""  which he claimed he had composed on the spur of the moment , writing  it on the cuff of his shirt sleeve .

"<fairy>  But one morning , turning to pass the doubloon , he seemed to be newly  attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it , as  though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in  some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them .
"	"And some  certain significance lurks in all things , else all things are little  worth , and the round world itself but an empty cipher , except to sell  by the cartload , as they do hills about Boston , to fill up some morass  in the Milky Way .  Now this doubloon was of purest , virgin gold , raked somewhere out of  the heart of gorgeous hills , whence , east and west , over golden sands ,  the head - waters of many a Pactolus flows . And though now nailed amidst  all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes ,  yet , untouchable and immaculate to any foulness , it still preserved its  Quito glow . Nor , though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour  passed by ruthless hands , and through the livelong nights shrouded with  thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach , nevertheless  every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last . For it  was set apart and sanctified to one awe - striking end ; and however  wanton in their sailor ways , one and all , the mariners revered it as  the white whale ’s talisman . Sometimes they talked it over in the weary  watch by night , wondering whose it was to be at last , and whether he  would ever live to spend it .  Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun  and tropic token - pieces . Here palms , alpacas , and volcanoes ; sun ’s  disks and stars ; ecliptics , horns - of - plenty , and rich banners waving ,  are in luxuriant profusion stamped ; so that the precious gold seems  almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories , by  passing through those fancy mints , so Spanishly poetic .  It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy  example of these things . On its round border it bore the letters ,  REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR : QUITO . So this bright coin came from a country  planted in the middle of the world , and beneath the great equator , and  named after it ; and it had been cast midway up the Andes , in the  unwaning clime that knows no autumn . Zoned by those letters you saw the  likeness of three Andes ’ summits ; from one a flame ; a tower on another ;  on the third a crowing cock ; while arching over all was a segment of  the partitioned zodiac , the signs all marked with their usual  cabalistics , and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at  Libra .  Before this equatorial coin ,

"<fairy> At last , one day the biggest lion was  chasing a hare which was blind , for it ran straight over stock and  stone , and the end was , it ran right up against a fir - stump and  tumbled head over heels across the field right into a spring ; but lo !  when it came out of the spring it saw its way quite plain , and so  saved its life .
"	" "" So , so ! "" thought the lion , and went and dragged the lad to the  spring , and dipped him over head and ears in it . So , when he had got  his sight again , he went down to the shore and made signs to the lions  that they should all lie close together like a raft ; then he stood  upon their backs while they swam with him to the mainland . When he had  reached the shore he went up into a birchen copse , and made the lions  lie quiet . Then he stole up to the castle , like a thief , to see if he  could n't lay hands on his belt ; and when he got to the door , he peeped  through the keyhole , and there he saw his belt hanging up over a door  in the kitchen . So he crept softly in across the floor , for there was  no one there ; but as soon as he had got hold of the belt , he began to  kick and stamp about as though he were mad . Just then his mother came  rushing out :  "" Dear heart , my darling little boy ! do give me the belt again , "" she  said .  "" Thank you kindly , "" said he . "" Now you shall have the doom you passed  on me , "" and he fulfilled it on the spot . When the old _ Troll _ heard  that , he came in and begged and prayed so prettily that he might not  be smitten to death .  "" Well , you may live , "" said the lad , "" but you shall undergo the same  punishment you gave me ; "" and so he burned out the _ Troll 's _ eyes , and  turned him adrift on the sea in a little boat , but he had no lions to  follow him .  Now the lad was all alone , and he went about longing and longing for  the _ Princess _ ; at last he could bear it no longer ; he must set out to  seek her , his heart was so bent on having her . So he loaded four ships  and set sail for Arabia .  For some time they had fair wind and fine weather , but after that they  lay wind - bound under a rocky island . So the sailors went ashore and  strolled about to spend the time , and there they found a huge egg ,  almost as big as a little house . So they began to knock it about with  large stones , but , after all , they could n't crack the shell

"	"And when he had eaten it he  swelled so till he brast , and there Sir Patrise fell down suddenly dead  among them .  Then every knight leapt from the board ashamed , and araged for wrath ,  nigh out of their wits . For they wist not what to say ; considering  Queen Guenever made the feast and dinner , they all had suspicion unto  her . My lady , the queen , said Gawaine , wit ye well , madam , that this  dinner was made for me , for all folks that know my condition understand  that I love well fruit , and now I see well I had near been slain ;  therefore , madam , I dread me lest ye will be shamed . Then the queen  stood still and was sore abashed , that she nist not what to say . This  shall not so be ended , said Sir Mador de la Porte , for here have I lost  a full noble knight of my blood ; and therefore upon this shame and  despite I will be revenged to the utterance . And there openly Sir Mador  appealed the queen of the death of his cousin , Sir Patrise . Then stood  they all still , that none would speak a word against him , for they all  had great suspicion unto the queen because she let make that dinner .  And the queen was so abashed that she could none other ways do , but  wept so heartily that she fell in a swoon . With this noise and cry came  to them King Arthur , and when he wist of that trouble he was a passing  heavy man .  CHAPTER IV . How Sir Mador appeached the queen of treason , and there was  no knight would fight for her at the first time .  And ever Sir Mador stood still afore the king , and ever he appealed the  queen of treason ; for the custom was such that time that all manner of  shameful death was called treason . Fair lords , said King Arthur , me  repenteth of this trouble , but the case is so I may not have ado in  this matter , for I must be a rightful judge ; and that repenteth me that  I may not do battle for my wife , for as I deem this deed came never by  her . And therefore I suppose she shall not be all distained , but that  some good knight shall put his body in jeopardy for my queen rather  than she shall be brent in a wrong quarrel . And therefore , Sir Mador ,  be not so hasty , for it may happen she shall not be all friendless ;

They went into the kitchen  through one of the doors , and there all the things were bright and  shining , as if they were made of silver . The child asked the dwarf if  they were really silver , but he said oh , dear , no , only Britannia .

In this grand state they travelled to the  prince 's country , which was not a great many miles off . When they  reached it they pitched their tents on the same plain in which the  prince had been left in his box by the nurse , where Shankar and Suri  had swallowed him so often .  When the King , his father , the gardener 's daughter 's husband , saw the  prince 's camp , he was very much alarmed , and thought a great King had  come to make war on him . He sent one of his servants , therefore , to  ask whose camp it was . The young prince then wrote him a letter , in  which he said , "" You are a great King . Do not fear me .

"	"And in likewise he searched  his body of other three wounds , and they healed in likewise ; and then  the last of all he searched the which was in his hand , and anon it  healed fair .  Then King Arthur and all the kings and knights kneeled down and gave  thankings and lovings unto God and to His Blessed Mother . And ever Sir  Launcelot wept as he had been a child that had been beaten . Then King  Arthur let array priests and clerks in the most devoutest manner , to  bring in Sir Urre within Carlisle , with singing and loving to God . And  when this was done , the king let clothe him in the richest manner that  could be thought ; and then were there but few better made knights in  all the court , for he was passingly well made and bigly ; and Arthur  asked Sir Urre how he felt himself . My good lord , he said , I felt  myself never so lusty . Will ye joust and do deeds of arms ? said King  Arthur . Sir , said Urre , an I had all that longed unto jousts I would be  soon ready .  CHAPTER XIII . How there was a party made of an hundred knights against  an hundred knights , and of other matters .  Then Arthur made a party of hundred knights to be against an hundred  knights . And so upon the morn they jousted for a diamond , but there  jousted none of the dangerous knights ; and so for to shorten this tale ,  Sir Urre and Sir Lavaine jousted best that day , for there was none of  them but he overthrew and pulled down thirty knights ; and then by the  assent of all the kings and lords , Sir Urre and Sir Lavaine were made  knights of the Table Round . And Sir Lavaine cast his love unto Dame  Felelolie , Sir Urre ’s sister , and then they were wedded together with  great joy , and King Arthur gave to everych of them a barony of lands .  And this Sir Urre would never go from Sir Launcelot , but he and Sir  Lavaine awaited evermore upon him ; and they were in all the court  accounted for good knights , and full desirous in arms ; and many noble  deeds they did , for they would have no rest , but ever sought  adventures .  Thus they lived in all that court with great noblesse and joy long  time . But every night and day Sir Agravaine , Sir Gawaine ’s brother ,  awaited Queen Guenever and Sir Launcelot du Lake to put them to a  rebuke and shame . And

"	"Sir , said  Lamorak , wit thou well , I owe you my service , but as at this time I  will not abide here , for I see of mine enemies many about me . Alas ,  said Arthur , now wot I well it is Sir Lamorak de Galis . O Lamorak ,  abide with me , and by my crown I shall never fail thee : and not so  hardy in Gawaine ’s head , nor none of his brethren , to do thee any  wrong . Sir , said Sir Lamorak , wrong have they done me , and to you both .  That is truth , said the king , for they slew their own mother and my  sister , the which me sore grieveth : it had been much fairer and better  that ye had wedded her , for ye are a king ’s son as well as they . O  Jesu , said the noble knight Sir Lamorak unto Arthur , her death shall I  never forget . I promise you , and make mine avow unto God , I shall  revenge her death as soon as I see time convenable . And if it were not  at the reverence of your highness I should now have been revenged upon  Sir Gawaine and his brethren . Truly , said Arthur , I will make you at  accord .

Then there was a damosel that was daughter to King Bandes . And there  was a Saracen knight that hight Corsabrin , and he loved the damosel ,  and in no wise he would suffer her to be married ; for ever this  Corsabrin noised her , and named her that she was out of her mind ; and  thus he let her that she might not be married .  CHAPTER XLVII . How Sir Palomides fought with Corsabrin for a lady , and  how Palomides slew Corsabrin .  So by fortune this damosel heard tell that Palomides did much for  damosels ’ sake ; so she sent to him a pensel , and prayed him to fight  with Sir Corsabrin for her love , and he should have her and her lands  of her father ’s that should fall to her . Then the damosel sent unto  Corsabrin , and bade him go unto Sir Palomides that was a paynim as well  as he , and she gave him warning that she had sent him her pensel , and  if he might overcome Palomides she would we d him .

"<fantasy>  CHAPTER X.   HOW IT FARED WITH THE THREE LADIES AFTER THE ESCAPE OF  BIRDALONE .
"	" VIRIDIS took up the word without more ado , and said : I will do my best  herein , and ye , sisters , must set me right if I err .   When we had seen  the last of you , dear Birdalone , that early morning , we turned back again  to the house as speedily and as covertly as we might , lest the witch  might espy our disarray and question us thereover .   Then we went to the  wonder - coffer , and gat thereout raiment for that which we had given away ,  which was easy for us to do , whereas the witch - mistress was so slothful  that she had given to us the words of might wherewith to compel the  coffer to yield , so that we might do all the service thereof , and she not  to move hand or foot in the matter .   So when we were clad , and the time  was come , we went into the hall , by no means well assured of our  mistress .  When we came before her , she looked on us in surly wise , as her wo nt was ,  and said nought for a while ; she stared on us and knit her brows , as if  she strove to call to mind something that ran to and fro in her memory ;  and I noted that , and for my part I trembled before her .   But she spake  at last : Meseemeth as if there is a woman in the isle besides you three ;  some misdoer that I was minded to punish .   Tell me , you ! was there not a  naked one who came into this hall a while ago , one whom I threatened with  pining ?   Atra , who was the boldest of us , bowed the knee before her , and  said : Nay , our lady , since when do stranger women come naked into thine  hall , and dare thee there ?  Said the witch : Yet have I an image of a naked woman standing down there  before me ; and if I have it in mine eye , so should ye .   Tell me  therefore , and beware , for We are not bidden to hold Our hand from you if  We take you in misdeeds .  If I quaked before , now much more I quaked , till my legs well - nigh failed  me for fear ; but Atra said : Great lady , this image will belike be of that  one whom a while ago ye had stripped and tied to a pillar here , and  tormented while ye feasted .  The lady looked on her

"<fantasy> ”  “ It is this , my lord , ” rejoined the old man : “ Woe to the rash mortal who  seeks to know that of which he should remain ignorant , and to undertake  that which surpasseth his power ! ”  “ And woe to thee ! ” cried the Caliph , in a burst of indignation ; “ to - day  thou art void of understanding .
"	"  Begone from my presence ; they shall burn  but the half of thy beard , because , thou wert yesterday fortunate in  guessing ; my gifts I never resume . ”  The old man , wise enough to perceive he had luckily escaped , considering  the folly of disclosing so disgusting a truth , immediately withdrew , and  appeared not again .  But it was not long before Vathek discovered abundant reason to regret  his precipitation ; for though he could not decipher the characters  himself , yet by constantly poring upon them he plainly perceived that  they every day changed , and unfortunately no other candidate offered to  explain them .   This perplexing occupation inflamed his blood , dazzled his  sight , and brought on a giddiness and debility that he could not support .  He failed not , however , though in so reduced a condition , to be often  carried to his tower , as he flattered himself that he might there read in  the stars which he went to consult something more congenial to his  wishes : but in this his hopes were deluded , for his eyes , dimmed by the  vapours of his head , began to subserve his curiosity so ill , that he  beheld nothing but a thick dun cloud , which he took for the most direful  of omens .  Agitated with so much anxiety , Vathek entirely lost all firmness ; a fever  seized him , and his appetite failed .   Instead of being one of the  greatest eaters , he became as distinguished for drinking .   So insatiable  was the thirst which tormented him that his mouth , like a funnel , was  always open to receive the various liquors that might be poured into it ,  and especially cold water , which calmed him more than every other .  This unhappy prince being thus incapacitated for the enjoyment of any  pleasure , commanded the palaces of the five senses to be shut up , forbore  to appear in public , either to display his magnificence or administer  justice , and retired to the inmost apartment of his harem .   As he had  ever been an indulgent husband , his wives , overwhelmed with grief at his  deplorable situation , incessantly offered their prayers for his health ,  and unremittingly supplied him with water .  In the meantime the Princess Carathis , whose affliction no words can  describe , instead of restraining herself to sobbing and tears , was  closeted daily with the Vizir Morakanabad , to find out some cure or  mitigation of the Caliph ’s disease .   Under the persuasion that it was  caused by enchantment , they turned over together , leaf by leaf

"<fairy> ”  The King was terrified when he heard that he himself must kill his  dearest children , but he thought of faithful John ’s great fidelity , and  how he had died for him , drew his sword , and with his own hand cut off  the children ’s heads .
"	"And when he had smeared the stone with their  blood , life returned to it , and Faithful John stood once more safe and  healthy before him . He said to the King , “ Thy truth shall not go  unrewarded , ” and took the heads of the children , put them on again , and  rubbed the wounds with their blood , on which they became whole again  immediately , and jumped about , and went on playing as if nothing had  happened . Then the King was full of joy , and when he saw the Queen  coming he hid Faithful John and the two children in a great cupboard .  When she entered , he said to her , “ Hast thou been praying in the  church ? ” “ Yes , ” answered she , “ but I have constantly been thinking of  Faithful John and what misfortune has befallen him through us . ” Then  said he , “ Dear wife , we can give him his life again , but it will cost  us our two little sons , whom we must sacrifice . ” The Queen turned pale ,  and her heart was full of terror , but she said , “ We owe it to him , for  his great fidelity . ” Then the King was rejoiced that she thought as he  had thought , and went and opened the cupboard , and brought forth  Faithful John and the children , and said , “ God be praised , he is  delivered , and we have our little sons again also , ” and told her how  everything had occurred . Then they dwelt together in much happiness  until their death .  7 The Good Bargain  There was once a peasant who had driven his cow to the fair , and sold  her for seven thalers . On the way home he had to pass a pond , and  already from afar he heard the frogs crying , “ Aik , aik , aik , aik . ”  “ Well , ” said he to himself , “ they are talking without rhyme or reason ,  it is seven that I have received , not eight . ” When he got to the water ,  he cried to them , “ Stupid animals that you are ! Do n’t you know better  than that ? It is seven thalers and not eight . ” The frogs , however ,  stood to their , “ aik aik , aik , aik . ” “ Come , then , if you wo n’t believe  it , I can count it out to you . ” And he took his money out of his pocket  and counted out the seven thalers , always

"	"We can easily corner her on the beach  somewhere , when we ’re ready . Meanwhile , we must get the kid  letter - perfect . First rehearsal for lines and business eleven sharp  to - morrow . ”  Poor old Freddie was in such a gloomy state of mind that we decided not  to tell him the idea till we had finished coaching the kid . He was n’t  in the mood to have a thing like that hanging over him . So we  concentrated on Tootles . And pretty early in the proceedings we saw  that the only way to get Tootles worked up to the spirit of the thing  was to introduce sweets of some sort as a sub - motive , so to speak .  “ The chief difficulty , ” said Jimmy Pinkerton at the end of the first  rehearsal , “ is to establish a connection in the kid ’s mind between his  line and the sweets . Once he has grasped the basic fact that those two  words , clearly spoken , result automatically in acid - drops , we have got  a success . ”  I ’ve often thought , do n’t you know , how interesting it must be to be  one of those animal - trainer Johnnies : to stimulate the dawning  intelligence , and that sort of thing . Well , this was every bit as  exciting . Some days success seemed to be staring us in the eye , and the  kid got the line out as if he ’d been an old professional . And then he ’d  go all to pieces again . And time was flying .  “ We must hurry up , Jimmy , ” I said . “ The kid ’s uncle may arrive any day  now and take him away . ”  “ And we have n’t an understudy , ” said Jimmy . “ There ’s something in that .  We must work ! My goodness , that kid ’s a bad study . I ’ve known  deaf - mutes who would have learned the part quicker . ”  I will say this for the kid , though : he was a trier . Failure did n’t  discourage him . Whenever there was any kind of sweet near he had a dash  at his line , and kept on saying something till he got what he was  after . His only fault was his uncertainty . Personally , I would have  been prepared to risk it , and start the performance at the first  opportunity , but Jimmy said no .  “ We ’re not nearly ready , ” said Jimmy . “ To - day , for instance , he said  ‘ Kick Freddie . ’ That

"<fairy>  "" Here , Princess Dorothy , "" the thoughtful little maid said , "" Listen to  the story of the poppy blossom and you 'll be sure to sleep well .
"	"""  So Dorothy listened to the soft , slumbrous voice of the poppy and was  asleep almost before the tale was finished .  What kind of a story did the sweet poppy tell ? Why , a bedtime story , of  course .  CHAPTER 13  The Three Swans  Dorothy was awakened by the sunlight streaming through the windows of  her bedroom . Refreshed and eager for the adventures that lay ahead , she  bathed and dressed and , with Felina in her arms , knocked on the door of  the Wizard 's room .  The man was already awake and in excellent spirits as he greeted  Dorothy . A moment later Dolly and Poppet came to lead them to the  living room where Ozana was awaiting them for breakfast .  The Fairy Princess , radiant with loveliness , was dressed in a simple ,  blue dress with a circlet of roses set in her golden hair . Dorothy  thought this an excellent crown for the Princess of Story Blossom  Garden .  When the meal was finished , Ozana said , "" It will please you to learn  that my studies which I completed late last night revealed that the  Mimic King and Queen have accomplished no real harm in the Emerald  City . However , Queen Ra has succeeded in doing something that has  surprised me . She has thrown up a magic screen about her activities  which has made it impossible for me to discover whether she has  found the spell that would release the Mimics from Queen Lurline 's  enchantment . It is logical to believe Ra has failed , since , if she had  discovered the spell , she would surely have used it to permit the Mimic  hordes to overrun Oz . ""  "" But you can not be sure . Is that it , Ma'am ? "" asked the Wizard .  "" Yes , I am afraid so , "" Ozana admitted , frowning slightly .  "" This magic screen that Queen Ra has devised baffles me and resists all  my efforts to penetrate it . For this reason I think it would be wise  for us to go as quickly as possible to the Emerald City . As you know ,  Ozma and Glinda will return from the Forest of Burzee this morning at  ten o'clock . I would like to be present to greet them and to explain  what has happened . There is no use causing them undue alarm . After all ,  I am responsible for the Mimics in regard to the Land of Oz , "" Ozana  concluded thoughtfully .  "" Well , "" said Dorothy , "" I 'm ready to go . How about you , Wizard ? ""

"<fairy> After they had expected him so long , he was coming  to quench his thirst with the water of Pirene .
"	" Nearer and nearer came the aerial wonder , flying in great circles , as  you may have seen a dove when about to alight . Downward came Pegasus ,  in those wide , sweeping circles , which grew narrower , and narrower  still , as he gradually approached the earth . The nigher the view of  him , the more beautiful he was , and the more marvelous the sweep of  his silvery wings . At last , with so light a pressure as hardly to bend  the grass about the fountain , or imprint a hoof - tramp in the sand of  its margin , he alighted , and , stooping his wild head , began to drink .  He drew in the water , with long and pleasant sighs , and tranquil  pauses of enjoyment ; and then another draught , and another , and  another . For , nowhere in the world , or up among the clouds , did  Pegasus love any water as he loved this of Pirene . And when his thirst  was slaked , he cropped a few of the honey - blossoms of the clover ,  delicately tasting them , but not caring to make a hearty meal , because  the herbage , just beneath the clouds , on the lofty sides of Mount  Helicon , suited his palate better than this ordinary grass .  After thus drinking to his heart 's content , and , in his dainty  fashion , condescending to take a little food , the winged horse began  to caper to and fro , and dance as it were , out of mere idleness and  sport . There never was a more playful creature made than this very  Pegasus . So there he frisked , in a way that it delights me to think  about , fluttering his great wings as lightly as ever did a linnet , and  running little races , half on earth and half in air , and which I know  not whether to call a flight or a gallop . When a creature is  perfectly able to fly , he sometimes chooses to run , just for the  pastime of the thing ; and so did Pegasus , although it cost him some  little trouble to keep his hoofs so near the ground . Bellerophon ,  meanwhile , holding the child 's hand , peeped forth from the shrubbery ,  and thought that never was any sight so beautiful as this , nor ever a  horse 's eyes so wild and spirited as those of Pegasus . It seemed a sin  to think of bridling him and riding on his back .  Once or twice , Pegasus stopped , and snuffed the air , pricking up his  ears , tossing

"<fantasy>  Rodriguez and Morano pressed on , and the mountains cloaked themselves  as they went , in air of many colours ; till the stars came out and the  lights of the village gleamed .
"	"In darkness , with surprise in the tones  of the barking dogs , the two wanderers came to the village where so few  ever came , for it lay at the end of Spain , cut off by those mighty  rocks , and they knew not much of what lands lay beyond .  They beat on a door below a hanging board , on which was written "" The  Inn of the World 's End "" : a wandering scholar had written it and had  been well paid for his work , for in those days writing was rare . The  door was opened for them by the host of the inn , and they entered a  room in which men who had supped were sitting at a table . They were all  of them men from the Spanish side of the mountains , farmers come into  the village on the affairs of Mother Earth ; next day they would be back  at their farms again ; and of the land the other side of the mountains  that was so near now they knew nothing , so that it still remained for  the wanderers a thing of mystery wherein romance could dwell : and  because they knew nothing of that land the men at the inn treasured all  the more the rumours that sometimes came from it , and of these they  talked , and mine host listened eagerly , to whom all tales were brought  soon or late ; and most he loved to hear tales from beyond the mountains .  Rodriguez and Morano sat still and listened , and the talk was all of  war . It was faint and vague like fable , but rumour clearly said War ,  and the other side of the mountains . It may be that no man has a crazy  ambition without at moments suspecting it ; but prove it by the  touchstone of fact and he becomes at once as a woman whose invalid son ,  after years of seclusion indoors , wins unexpectedly some athletic  prize . When Rodriguez heard all this talk of wars quite near he thought  of his castle as already won ; his thoughts went further even , floating  through Lowlight in the glowing evening , and drifting up and down past  Serafina 's house below the balcony where she sat for ever .  Some said the Duke would never attack the Prince because the Duke 's  aunt was a princess from the Troubadour 's country . Another said that  there would surely be war . Others said that there was war already , and  too late for man to stop it . All said it would soon be over .  And one man said that it was the last war that would

"<fantasy>  All this time the shrill , excited voice was loudly complaining because  the sailor was on his feet , and Trot looked to see who was making the  protest , while Cap'n Bill rolled over and got on his hands and knees so  he could pull his meat leg and his wooden leg into an upright position ,  which was n't a very easy thing to do .
"	" Button - Bright and Trot were staring with all their might at the  queerest person they had ever seen . They decided it must be a man  because he had two long legs , a body as round as a ball , a neck like an  ostrich , and a comical little head set on the top of it . But the most  curious thing about him was his skin , which was of a lovely sky - blue  tint . His eyes were also sky - blue , and his hair , which was trained  straight up and ended in a curl at the top of his head , was likewise  blue in color and matched his skin and his eyes . He wore tight - fitting  clothes made of sky - blue silk , with a broad blue ruffle around his long  neck , and on his breast glittered a magnificent jewel in the form of a  star , set with splendid blue stones .  If the blue man astonished the travelers , they were no less surprised  by his surroundings , for look where they might , everything they beheld  was of the same blue color as the sky above . They seemed to have landed  in a large garden , surrounded by a high wall of blue stone . The trees  were all blue , the grass was blue , the flowers were blue , and even the  pebbles in the paths were blue . There were many handsomely carved  benches and seats of blue wood scattered about the garden , and near  them stood a fountain made of blue marble , which shot lovely sprays of  blue water into the blue air .  But the angry inhabitants of this blue place would not permit them to  look around them in peace , for as soon as Cap'n Bill rolled off his  toes , he began dancing around in an excited way and saying very  disrespectful things of his visitors . "" You brutes ! You apes ! You  miserable , white - skinned creatures ! How dare you come into my garden  and knock me on the head with that awful basket and then fall on my  toes and cause me pain and suffering ? How dare you , I say ? Do n't you  know you will be punished for your impudence ? Do n't you know the  Boolooroo of the Blues will have revenge ? I can have you patched for  this insult , and I will -- just as sure as I 'm the Royal Boolooroo of Sky  Island ! ""  "" Oh , is this Sky Island , then ? "" asked Trot .  "" Of course it 's Sky Island . What else could it be ?

"	"The dwarf sprang up in a  fright , but he could not get to his cave , for the bear was already  close . Then in the dread of his heart he cried , “ Dear Mr. Bear , spare  me , I will give you all my treasures ; look , the beautiful jewels lying  there ! Grant me my life ; what do you want with such a slender little  fellow as I ? you would not feel me between your teeth . Come , take these  two wicked girls , they are tender morsels for you , fat as young quails ;  for mercy ’s sake eat them ! ” The bear took no heed of his words , but  gave the wicked creature a single blow with his paw , and he did not  move again .  The girls had run away , but the bear called to them , “ Snow - white and  Rose - red , do not be afraid ; wait , I will come with you . ” Then they knew  his voice and waited , and when he came up to them suddenly his bearskin  fell off , and he stood there , a handsome man , clothed all in gold . “ I  am a King ’s son , ” he said , “ and I was bewitched by that wicked dwarf ,  who had stolen my treasures ; I have had to run about the forest as a  savage bear until I was freed by his death . Now he has got his  well - deserved punishment . ”  Snow - white was married to him , and Rose - red to his brother , and they  divided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had gathered  together in his cave . The old mother lived peacefully and happily with  her children for many years . She took the two rose - trees with her , and  they stood before her window , and every year bore the most beautiful  roses , white and red .  162 The Wise Servant  How fortunate is the master , and how well all goes in his house , when  he has a wise servant who listens to his orders and does not obey them ,  but prefers following his own wisdom . A clever John of this kind was  once sent out by his master to seek a lost cow . He stayed away a long  time , and the master thought , “ Faithful John does not spare any pains  over his work ! ” As , however , he did not come back at all , the master  was afraid lest some misfortune had befallen him , and set out himself  to look for him .

"	" But in a little she dried her tears , and reproached herself for her much  softness ; and she ate her supper when she had lighted a candle ( for it  was now dark ) , and again sat looking at the hearth , till she said : Now am  I getting soft again , and who knows but my softness may tempt the ghosts  to come in to me .   I will give my hands somewhat to do .  Therewith her eye caught sight of the rents and rags of her old grey  gown , and she smiled somewhat ruefully as she called to mind her gallant  knight ’s array , which lay now on the shore of the evil and ruined isle ;  and her goodly attire of the days of the Five Crafts ; and the rich  raiment wherein her friends of the Castle of the Quest had clad her .  Then she arose and sought needle and thread and some remnants of green  cloth , and did off the ragged coat and fell to patching and mending it ,  and so sat at her work in smock - sewing till the night was old and she was  weary and sleep overcame her , and she lay down in her bed and slept  dreamlessly till the sun was high next morning .  CHAPTER XVIII .   THE WOOD - MOTHER COMETH TO BIRDALONE AND HEARETH HER  STORY .  NOW Birdalone arose and bathed her and broke her fast , and then went  about her work with the beasts and the dairy ; but all that time seemed  long to her till she had bow in hand and quiver on back , and was wending  her way to the Oak of Tryst ; and swift were her feet and her heart beat  quick with hope of pleasure .  Forsooth no long tarrying had she , for scarce had she set her down  beneath the oak , ere the wood - mother came forth from the thicket even as  the first time when Birdalone saw her , and presently she had her arms  about Birdalone and was kissing and clipping her .   Then they sat down  together in the shade of the great tree , and the wood - mother made much of  her friend with few words and those but simple , while Birdalone wept for  joy .  At last spake Birdalone : Wood - mother , my dear , I look in thy face , and I  see thee that thou art nowise changed , so that thou callest to my mind  the Birdalone that met thee here when she was straying from the House of  Captivity like to a bird with a string to its leg .

"<fantasy> He did this  in order that he might turn into his own pocket the full price of the  idols , grudging those who would otherwise have sold them the few cash  which they would make .
"	"Owing to this he had many enemies , and his army  of travellers made him still more ; for they were more rapacious than  the scorpion , and more obstinate than the ox . Indeed , there is still the  proverb , ‘ With honey it is possible to soften the heart of the he - goat ;  but a blow from an iron cleaver is taken as a mark of welcome by an  agent of Ti Hung . ’ So that people barred the doors at their approach ,  and even hung out signs of death and mourning .  “ Now , among all his travellers there was none more successful , more  abandoned , and more valuable to Ti Hung than Li Ting . So depraved was  Li Ting that he was never known to visit the tombs of his ancestors ;  indeed , it was said that he had been heard to mock their venerable  memories , and that he had jestingly offered to sell them to anyone who  should chance to be without ancestors of his own . This objectionable  person would call at the houses of the most illustrious Mandarins , and  would command the slaves to carry to their masters his tablets , on which  were inscribed his name and his virtues . Reaching their presence , he  would salute them with the greeting of an equal , ‘ How is your stomach ? ’  and then proceed to exhibit samples of his wares , greatly overrating  their value . ‘ Behold ! ’ he would exclaim , ‘ is not this elegantly - moulded  idol worthy of the place of honour in this sumptuous mansion which my  presence defiles to such an extent that twelve basins of rose - water  will not remove the stain ? Are not its eyes more delicate than the most  select of almonds ? and is not its stomach rounder than the cupolas upon  the high temple at Peking ? Yet , in spite of its perfections , it is not  worthy of the acceptance of so distinguished a Mandarin , and therefore  I will accept in return the quarter - tael , which , indeed , is less than my  illustrious master gives for the clay alone . ’  “ In this manner Li Ting disposed of many idols at high rates , and  thereby endeared himself so much to the avaricious heart of Ti Hung that  he promised him his beautiful daughter Ning in marriage .  “ Ning was indeed very lovely . Her eyelashes were like the finest willow  twigs that grow in the marshes by the Yang - tse - Kiang ; her cheeks were  fairer than poppies ; and when she bathed in the Hoang Ho , her body  seemed

Prepare me a ship of which the  half - rotten timbers shall be painted black , let the sails be in rags ,  and the sailors infirm and sickly . One shall have lost a leg , another  an arm , the third shall be a hunchback , another lame or club - footed or  blind , and most of them shall be ugly and covered with scars . Go , and  let my orders be executed . ”  The minister ’s son embarked in this old vessel , and thanks to favorable  winds , at length reached his own country . In spite of the pitiable  condition in which he returned they received him joyfully .  “ I am the first to come back , ” said he to the King ; now fulfil your  promise , and give me the princess in marriage .  So they at once began to prepare for the wedding festivities . As to the  poor princess , she was sorrowful and angry enough about it .  The next morning , at daybreak , a wonderful ship with every sail set came  to anchor before the town . The King happened at that moment to be at the  palace window .  “ What strange ship is this , ” he cried , “ that has a golden hull , silver  masts , and silken sails , and who are the young men like princes who man  it ? And do I not see St. Nicholas at the helm ? Go at once and invite the  captain of the ship to come to the palace . ”  His servants obeyed him , and very soon in came an enchantingly handsome  young prince , dressed in rich silk , ornamented with pearls and diamonds .  “ Young man , ” said the King , “ you are welcome , whoever you may be . Do me  the favor to be my guest as long as you remain in my capital . ”  “ Many thanks , sire , ” replied the captain , “ I accept your offer . ”  “ My daughter is about to be married , ” said the King ; “ will you give her  away ? ”  “ I shall be charmed , sire . ”  Soon after came the Princess and her betrothed .  “ Why , how is this ? ” cried the young captain ;

"	"Such an idol as that  found in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea ; and for  worshipping which , King Asa , her son , did depose her , and destroyed the  idol , and burnt it for an abomination at the brook Kedron , as darkly  set forth in the 15th chapter of the First Book of Kings .  Look at the sailor , called the mincer , who now comes along , and  assisted by two allies , heavily backs the grandissimus , as the mariners  call it , and with bowed shoulders , staggers off with it as if he were a  grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field . Extending it upon the  forecastle deck , he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt ,  as an African hunter the pelt of a boa . This done he turns the pelt  inside out , like a pantaloon leg ; gives it a good stretching , so as  almost to double its diameter ; and at last hangs it , well spread , in  the rigging , to dry . Ere long , it is taken down ; when removing some  three feet of it , towards the pointed extremity , and then cutting two  slits for arm - holes at the other end , he lengthwise slips himself  bodily into it . The mincer now stands before you invested in the full  canonicals of his calling . Immemorial to all his order , this  investiture alone will adequately protect him , while employed in the  peculiar functions of his office .  That office consists in mincing the horse - pieces of blubber for the  pots ; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse ,  planted endwise against the bulwarks , and with a capacious tub beneath  it , into which the minced pieces drop , fast as the sheets from a rapt  orator ’s desk . Arrayed in decent black ; occupying a conspicuous pulpit ;  intent on bible leaves ; what a candidate for an archbishopric , what a  lad for a Pope were this mincer ! *  * Bible leaves !

It enjoins him to be careful , and cut his work into as  thin slices as possible , inasmuch as by so doing the business of  boiling out the oil is much accelerated , and its quantity considerably  increased , besides perhaps improving it in quality .

"<fairy> <BOS> This fairy tale of a gormandizing people contains no      mention of Thanksgiving Day . <endprompt> Yet its connection with      our American festival is obvious . Every one who likes      fairy tales will enjoy reading it .  THE country of the Greedy , well known in history , was ruled by a king  who had much trouble . His subjects were well behaved , but they had one  sad fault : they were too fond of pies and tarts . It was as disagreeable  to them to swallow a spoonful of soup as if it were so much sea  water , and it would take a policeman to make them open their mouths  for a bit of meat , either boiled or roasted . This deplorable taste  made the fortunes of the pastry cooks , but also of the apothecaries .  Families ruined themselves in pills and powders ; camomile , rhubarb , and  peppermint trebled in price , as well as other disagreeable remedies ,  such as castor----which I will not name .  The King of the Greedy sought long for the means of correcting this  fatal passion for sweets , but even the faculty were puzzled .  "" Your Majesty , "" said the great court doctor , Olibriers , at his last  audience , "" your people look like putty ! They are incurable ; their  senseless love for good eating will bring them all to the grave . ""  This view of things did not suit the King . He was wise , and saw very  plainly that a monarch without subjects would be but a sorry king .  Happily , after this utter failure of the doctors , there came into the  mind of His Majesty a first - class idea : he telegraphed for Mother  Mitchel , the most celebrated of all pastry cooks . Mother Mitchel  soon arrived , with her black cat , Fanfreluche , who accompanied her  everywhere . He was an incomparable cat . He had not his equal as an  adviser and a taster of tarts .  Mother Mitchel having respectfully inquired what she and her cat could  do for His Majesty , the King demanded of the astonished pastry cook a  tart as big as the capitol -- bigger even , if possible , but no smaller !  When the King uttered this astounding order , deep emotion was shown by  the chamberlains , the pages , and lackeys . Nothing but the respect due  to his presence prevented them from crying "" Long live Your Majesty ! "" in  his very ears .

"	"So Robin stood in the middle of the road , waiting while  the other walked slowly forward , smelling his rose , and looking this way  and that , and everywhere except at Robin .  "" Hold ! "" cried Robin , when at last the other had come close to him .  "" Hold !   Stand where thou art ! ""  "" Wherefore should I hold , good fellow ? "" said the stranger in soft and  gentle voice .   "" And wherefore should I stand where I am ? Ne'ertheless ,  as thou dost desire that I should stay , I will abide for a short time ,  that I may hear what thou mayst have to say to me .

I would have thee know , fair friend , that I am , as it were , a votary at  the shrine of Saint Wilfred who , thou mayst know , took , willy - nilly , all  their gold from the heathen , and melted it up into candlesticks .

"<fantasy> But the truth of the  matter was that he had neither been an outlaw for a fraction of the  twentieth year , nor even for anything like nineteen years .
"	"He was  outlawed at the Thing held in 1016 , his year of outlawry dated from  Thing to Thing ; this talk befell in 1031 , consequently he had been  full fifteen years and no fraction of a year in outlawry . The story ,  therefore , of the twenty years , or nineteen years and a fraction , of  outlawry falls utterly to the ground when brought to the test of the  actual facts as recorded in the saga .  But , despite of this , it is not to be supposed that this episode at  the Thing in 1031 is brought in at random and without any cause . There  are two obvious reasons for assigning twenty years to the length of  Grettir 's outlawry , and for bringing into the tale a discussion on  that subject just where it is done . The one we may call the reason of  traditional belief , the other the reason of dramatic effect . Grettir  was indisputably for all reasons the greatest of Icelandic outlaws ,  and the fond imagination of his biographers at all times urged them  to give the longest endurance to the time of his outlawry above all  outlaws , without inquiring closely as to whether it agreed with  the saga itself or not . The other , or the dramatic motive , lies  in bringing in the discussion on this long outlawry just at this  particular Thing of 1031 ; for it was obviously the teller 's object to  suggest to the reader the hope of the great outlaw 's legal restoration  to the cherished society of man just before the falling of the  crushing blow , in order to give an enhanced tragic interest to his  end , and he undoubtedly succeeds in doing this . To these reasons ,  besides others less obvious , we imagine this main inconsistency in  Grettir 's saga is to be ascribed .  Nevertheless , it is worth observing that blunders of scribes may have  in a measure been at work here . If we are not mistaken most of the  existing MSS . of our saga state that when he fell ( p. 243 ) ' he was one  winter short of--<i > var hánum vetri fátt á</i>'--whatever number  of years they give as his age . And we venture the suggestion  that originally the passage ran thus : var hánum vetri fátt á hálf  iv{tugum},[21 ] < i > i.e.</i > , he lacked one winter of thirty - five years ,  when he was slain . If a subsequent scribe committed the easy blunder  of dropping I before V , the reading of our original ( Edition , 53 )  would be the natural result , and an offspring of that

She is        one of those girls who need never make the slightest effort to        have men fall in love with them . Two types of men seldom do : dull        men are usually afraid of her cleverness and intellectual men are        usually afraid of her beauty . All others are hers by natural        prerogative .        If ROSALIND could be spoiled the process would have been complete        by this time , and as a matter of fact , her disposition is not all        it should be ; she wants what she wants when she wants it and she        is prone to make every one around her pretty miserable when she        does n’t get it — but in the true sense she is not spoiled . Her        fresh enthusiasm , her will to grow and learn , her endless faith        in the inexhaustibility of romance , her courage and fundamental        honesty — these things are not spoiled .        There are long periods when she cordially loathes her whole        family . She is quite unprincipled ; her philosophy is carpe diem        for herself and laissez faire for others . She loves shocking        stories : she has that coarse streak that usually goes with        natures that are both fine and big . She wants people to like her ,        but if they do not it never worries her or changes her . She is by        no means a model character .

And so on we went up the Thames still -- or whither ?  CHAPTER XXX : THE JOURNEY 'S END  On we went .   In spite of my new - born excitement about Ellen , and my  gathering fear of where it would land me , I could not help taking  abundant interest in the condition of the river and its banks ; all the  more as she never seemed weary of the changing picture , but looked at  every yard of flowery bank and gurgling eddy with the same kind of  affectionate interest which I myself once had so fully , as I used to  think , and perhaps had not altogether lost even in this strangely changed  society with all its wonders .   Ellen seemed delighted with my pleasure at  this , that , or the other piece of carefulness in dealing with the river :  the nursing of pretty corners ; the ingenuity in dealing with difficulties  of water - engineering , so that the most obviously useful works looked  beautiful and natural also .   All this , I say , pleased me hugely , and she  was pleased at my pleasure -- but rather puzzled too .  "" You seem astonished , "" she said , just after we had passed a mill { 2 }  which spanned all the stream save the water - way for traffic , but which  was as beautiful in its way as a Gothic cathedral--""You seem astonished  at this being so pleasant to look at .

When he came again  to the stream , the Ass fell down on purpose in the same spot , and ,  regaining his feet with the weight of his load much diminished , brayed  triumphantly as if he had obtained what he desired . The Peddler saw  through his trick and drove him for the third time to the coast , where  he bought a cargo of sponges instead of salt .

And therewith he took Aurea by  the hand , and led her out of the boat and up the stair , and she all  joyous and wondering ; and thereafter came Hugh and his darling , and last  of all Arthur and Atra , and she alone of the three women looked downcast ,  and her eyes wandered about the throng that was before them there , as  though she sought something , yet feared to see it .  But when they were all standing together on the landing - plain , and the  folk were all about them in a ring , Sir Baudoin spake to the castellan  and said : Sir Aymeris , thee and other folk I see here ,

"	"  But  so it was , that now again she held her hand from my body , and scarce  cast a word at me ever , but gloomed at me , and fared as if hatred of me  had grown great in her heart .  "" So the days went by , and my feet had worn a path through the  wilderness to the Dale of Lore , and May had melted into June , and the  latter days of June were come .   And on Midsummer Day I went my ways to  the dale according to my wo nt , when , as I as driving on my goats  hastily I saw a bright thing coming over the heath toward me , and I  went on my way to meet it , for I had no fear now , except what fear of  my mistress lingered in my heart ; nay , I looked that everything I saw  of new should add some joy to my heart .   So presently I saw that it was  a weaponed man riding a white horse , and anon he had come up to me and  drawn rein before me .   I wondered exceedingly at beholding him and the  heart leaped within me at his beauty ; for though the carline had told  me of the loveliness of the sons of men , that was but words and I knew  not what they meant ; and the others that I had seen were not young men  or goodly , and those last , as I told thee , I could scarce see their  faces .  "" And this one was even fairer than the dead woman that I had buried ,  whose face was worn with toil and trouble , as now I called to mind .   He  was clad in bright shining armour with a gay surcoat of green ,  embroidered with flowers over it ; he had a light sallet on his head ,  and the yellow locks of his hair flowed down from under , and fell on  his shoulders :   his face was as beardless as thine , dear friend , but  not clear brown like to thine but white and red like a blossom . ""  Ralph spake and said :   "" Belike it was a woman ; "" and his voice sounded  loud in the quiet place .   She smiled on him and kissed his cheek , and  said :   "" Nay , nay , dear Champion , it is not so .   God rest his soul ! many  a year he has been dead . ""  Said Ralph :   "" Many a year ! what meanest thou ? ""   "" Ah ! "" she said

"	"Greater and greater grew his stature as he went  northwards and ever more kingly his mien . Now he took baronies at  a stride and now counties and came again to the snow - white frozen  lands where the wolves came out to meet him and , draping himself  anew with old grey clouds , strode through the gates of his invincible  home , two old ice barriers swinging on pillars of ice that had never  known the sun .  So the town was left to Spring . And she peered about to see  what she could do with it . Presently she saw a dejected dog coming  prowling down the road , so she sang to him and he gambolled . I saw  him next day strutting by with something of an air . Where there were  trees she went to them and whispered , and they sang the arboreal  song that only trees can hear , and the green buds came peeping out as  stars while yet it is twilight , secretly one by one . She went to gardens  and awaked from dreaming the warm maternal earth . In little patches  bare and desolate she called up like a flame the golden crocus , or its  purple brother like an emperor 's ghost . She gladdened the graceless  backs of untidy houses , here with a weed , there with a little grass .  She said to the air , "" Be joyous . ""  Children began to know that daisies blew in unfrequented corners .  Buttonholes began to appear in the coats of the young men . The work  of Spring was accomplished .  HOW THE ENEMY CAME TO THLUNRANA  It had been prophesied of old and foreseen from the ancient days that  its enemy would come upon Thlunrana . And the date of its doom was  known and the gate by which it would enter , yet none had prophesied  of the enemy who he was save that he was of the gods though he dwelt  with men . Meanwhile Thlunrana , that secret lamaserai , that chief  cathedral of wizardry , was the terror of the valley in which it stood  and of all lands round about it . So narrow and high were the windows  and so strange when lighted at night that they seemed to regard men  with the demoniac leer of something that had a secret in the dark . Who  were the magicians and the deputy - magicians and the great arch - wizard  of that furtive place nobody knew , for they went veiled and hooded and  cloaked completely in black .  Though her doom was close upon her and the enemy of prophecy  should come that very night through the open ,

"	" "" As I was saying , ma'am , "" continued Mrs. Watkinson , "" we never give  parties . We leave all sinful things to the vain and foolish . My  daughter Jane has been telling me , that she heard this morning of a  party that is going on tonight at the widow St. Leonard 's . It is only  fifteen years since her husband died . He was carried off with a three  days ' illness , but two months after they were married . I have had a  domestic that lived with them at the time , so I know all about it . And  there she is now , living in an elegant house , and riding in her  carriage , and dressing and dashing , and giving parties , and enjoying  life , as she calls it . Poor creature , how I pity her ! Thank heaven ,  nobody that I know goes to her parties . If they did I would never wish  to see them again in my house . It is an encouragement to folly and  nonsense -- and folly and nonsense are sinful . Do not you think so ,  ma'am ? ""  "" If carried too far they may certainly become so , "" replied Mrs.  Morland .  "" We have heard , "" said Edward , "" that Mrs. St. Leonard , though one of  the ornaments of the gay world , has a kind heart , a beneficent spirit  and a liberal hand . ""  "" I know very little about her , "" replied Mrs. Watkinson , drawing up her  head , "" and I have not the least desire to know any more . It is well  she has no children ; they 'd be lost sheep if brought up in her fold .  For my part , ma'am , "" she continued , turning to Mrs. Morland , "" I am  quite satisfied with the quiet joys of a happy home . And no mother has  the least business with any other pleasures . My innocent babes know  nothing about plays , and balls , and parties ; and they never shall . Do  they look as if they had been accustomed to a life of pleasure ? ""  They certainly did not ! for when the Morlands took a glance at them ,  they thought they had never seen youthful faces that were less gay ,  and indeed less prepossessing .  There was not a good feature or a pleasant expression among them all .  Edward Morland recollected his having often read "" that childhood is  always lovely .

"<fantasy>  And I went painfully because of my weakness , and because also of the  great stones ; and sometimes I went along a spot of earth where the  river had been used to flow in flood - time , and which was now bare of  everything but stones ; and the sun , now risen high , poured down on  everything a great flood of fierce light and scorching heat , and burnt  me sorely , so that I almost fainted .
"	" But about noontide I entered a wood close by the stream , a beech - wood ,  intending to rest myself ; the herbage was thin and scattered there ,  sprouting up from amid the leaf - sheaths and nuts of the beeches , which  had fallen year after year on that same spot ; the outside boughs swept  low down , the air itself seemed green when you entered within the  shadow of the branches , they over - roofed the place so with tender  green , only here and there showing spots of blue .  But what lay at the foot of a great beech tree but some dead knight in  armour , only the helmet off ? A wolf was prowling round about it , who  ran away snarling when he saw me coming .  So I went up to that dead knight , and fell on my knees before him ,  laying my head on his breast , for it was Arnald . He was quite cold ,  but had not been dead for very long ; I would not believe him dead , but  went down to the stream and brought him water , tried to make him  drink - what would you ? He was as dead as Swanhilda : neither came there  any answer to my cries that afternoon but the moaning of the wood  doves in the beeches . So then I sat down and took his head on my  knees , and closed the eyes , and wept quietly while the sun sank lower .  But a little after sunset I heard a rustle through the leaves , that  was not the wind , and looking up my eyes met the pitying eyes of that  maiden .  Something stirred rebelliously within me ; I ceased weeping , and said :  "" It is unjust , unfair : What right had Swanhilda to live ? Did not God  give her up to us ? How much better was he than ten Swanhildas ?  And look you -- See !   He is DEAD . ""  Now this I shrieked out , being mad ; and though I trembled when I saw  some stormy wrath that vexed her very heart and loving lips , gathering  on her face , I yet sat there looking at her and screaming , screaming ,  till all the place rang .  But when growing hoarse and breathless I ceased ; she said , with  straitened brow and scornful mouth : "" So ! Bravely done ! Must I then ,  though I am a woman , call you a liar , for saying God is unjust ? You to  punish her , had not God then punished her already ? How many times when

"<fantasy>  And alway , as we talked , very hushed , we lookt downward into the  deepness of the Gorge , unto the upward end of the fire - light ; but there  came no thing yet unto our knowledge , only that the stinking did rise up  to us through that great distance .
"	" And the fire - pit to seem now a very small burning , and to give no great  light up to us ; and we neither to be abled to see very clear of the  Gorge bottom , in that the haze of the fumes and the smoke was in the air  of the Gorge , and made uncertainty ; and we to be nowise proper free of  the smoke , even where we did be .  And we watched , very set with anxiousness and fearful expecting of the  monster ; and did be both yet lost of breath , and the Maid that she made  her words something broken for a little while .  And lo ! in a moment , Naani cried out very low and sharp that the thing  did come ; and I to see a moving of somewhat , in the same instant , in the  Gorge that lay upon the upward side of the fire - pit .  And immediately I saw the great and monster head of the Beast come  forward into the shine from the pit ; and the head did be of a blotched  white , and to have the eyes upon great stalks that came from the forward  part of the head ; and the stalks to be set downward , so that the eyes  lookt upon the bottom parts of the Gorge . And surely this doth be very  horrid - seeming to the mind of this age , but yet to have a less  strangeness unto the two of us that had seen many horrid sights , as you  do know .  And as the Monster came forward the more into the light , I saw that the  great and utter mighty bulk did be all of that same whiteness , that did  be so set over with blotchings and a seeming of unhealth . But , truly the  colour was proper to a creature that did abide in so great a darkness ,  as you shall say , yet had those Slugs that we did see , been black and  shining , for the most , as I have told ; and this to be as I saw , and I  not to heed here that I try unto explainings in this place ; else should  I be never eased of my task , as you do see .  And the Monster Slug came onward , and as it did go , it set the stalks of  the eyes in among the boulders , as that it did search ; swayed now this  way and now that way , from side to side of the Gorge , and alway it  pushed the stalks of the eyes inward among the boulders ; and so to go

"	" When the tale of the castle and those great towers was done , the wind  that blew from the snow touched all the hearers ; they had seemed to be  away by the bank of the Ebro in the heat and light of Spain , and now  the vast night stripped them and the peaks seemed to close round on  them . They wrapped themselves in blankets and lay down in their  shelters . For a while they heard the wind waving branches and the thump  of a horse 's hoof restless at night ; then they all slept except one  that guarded the captive , and the captive himself who long lay thinking  and thinking .  Dawn stole through the wood and waked none of the sleepers ; the birds  all shouted at them , still they slept on ; and then the captive 's guard  wakened Morano and he stirred up the sparks of the fire and cooked , and  they breakfasted late . And soon they left the wood and faced the bleak  slope , all of them going on foot and leading their horses .  And the track crawled on till it came to the scorn of the peaks ,  winding over a shoulder of the Pyrenees , where the peaks gaze cold and  contemptuous away from the things of man .  In the presence of those that bore them company Rodriguez and Morano  felt none of the deadly majesty of those peaks that regard so awfully  over the solitudes . They passed through them telling cheerfully of wars  the four knights had known : and descended and came by sunset to the  lower edge of the snow . They pushed on a little farther and then  camped ; and with branches from the last camp that they had heaped on  their horses they made another great fire and , huddling round it in the  blankets that they had brought , found warmth even there so far from the  hearths of men .  And dawn and the cold woke them all on that treeless slope by barely  warm embers . Morano cooked again and they ate in silence . And then the  four knights rose sadly and one bowed and told Rodriguez how they must  now go back to their own country . And grief seized on Rodriguez at his  words , seeing that he was to lose four old friends at once and perhaps  for ever , for when men have fought under the same banner in war they  become old friends on that morning .  "" Señors , "" said Rodriguez , "" we may never meet again ! ""  And the other looked back to the peaks beyond which the far lands lay ,  and made a

"<fantasy>   Nay , I deem that the lovelings be stowed away  in some corner of the isle without the house , and that mayhappen we shall  find them there ; and yet I trow not before we have made guile meet guile ,  and overcome the sorceress .
"	"  But come now , let us be doing , and begin to  quarter this little land as the kestrel doth the water - meadow ; and leave  we our armour , lest we weary us , for we shall have no need for hard  strokes .  We hung up there on the tree helm and shield and hauberk , and all our  defences , and went our ways quartering the isle ; and the work was  toilsome , but we rested not till the time was come to keep tryst with the  lady ; and all that while we found no sign of the darling ones : and the  isle was everywhere a meadow as fair as a garden , with little copses of  sweet - growing trees here and there , and goodly brooks of water , but no  tillage anywhere : wild things , as hart and buck and roe , we came upon ,  and smaller deer withal , but all unhurtful to man ; but of herding was no  token .  Came we then back to that lordly perron , and there , at the foot thereof ,  stood the witch - wife , and received us joyously ; clad was she all  gloriously in red scarlet broidered and begemmed ; her arms bare and her  feet sandalled , and her yellow hair hanging down from under its garland ;  and certainly it was so that she had grown fairer , and was sleek and  white and well - shapen , and well - haired ; yet by all that , the visage of  her was little bettered , and unto me she was loathsome .  Now the feast went much as the earlier meal had done ; and Baudoin was  surly and Arthur blithe and buxom ; and nought befell to tell of , save  that dishes and meats , and flasks and cups , and all things came upon the  board as if they were borne thereon by folk unseen ; and thereat we  wondered not much , considering in what wonder - house we were .   But the  lady - witch looked on us and smiled , and said : Knights , ye marvel at the  manner of our service , but call to mind that we told you this morning  that we were enough for Ourselves , and we have so dight our days here  that whoso is our friend on this Isle of Increase shall lack nothing .  Fear not , therefore , to see aught ugly in our servants as now unseen , if  their shapes were made manifest unto you .

"<fantasy> It was a number of these insects that King - y - Yang vindictively  placed in the box which he instructed Sen to carry to Yun , well knowing  that the reception which would be accorded to anyone who appeared there  on such a mission would be of so fatally destructive a kind that the  consideration of his return need not engage a single conjecture .
"	" “ Entirely tranquil in intellect -- for the possibility of King - y - Yang ’s  intention being in any way other than what he had represented it to  be did not arise within Sen ’s ingenuous mind -- the person in question  cheerfully set forth on his long but unavoidable march towards the  region of Yun . As he journeyed along the way , the nature of his  meditation brought up before him the events which had taken place since  his arrival at Hankow ; and , for the first time , it was brought within  his understanding that the story of the youth and the three tigers ,  which his father had related to him , was in the likeness of a proverb ,  by which counsel and warning is conveyed in a graceful and inoffensive  manner . Readily applying the fable to his own condition , he could not  doubt but that the first two animals to be overthrown were represented  by the two undertakings which he had already conscientiously performed  in the matter of the mechanical ducks and the inlaid boxes , and the  conviction that he was even then engaged on the third and last trial  filled him with an intelligent gladness so unobtrusive and refined that  he could express his entrancing emotions in no other way than by lifting  up his voice and uttering the far - reaching cries which he had used on  the first of the occasions just referred to .  “ In this manner the first part of the journey passed away with engaging  celerity . Anxious as Sen undoubtedly was to complete the third task , and  approach the details which , in his own case , would correspond with the  command of the bowmen and the marriage with the Mandarin ’s daughter of  the person in the story , the noontide heat compelled him to rest in the  shade by the wayside for a lengthy period each day . During one of  these pauses it occurred to his versatile mind that the time which was  otherwise uselessly expended might be well disposed of in endeavouring  to increase the value and condition of the creatures under his care by  instructing them in the performance of some simple accomplishments ,  such as might not be too laborious for their feeble and immature  understanding . In this he was more successful than he had imagined could  possibly be the case , for the discriminating insects , from the first ,  had every appearance of recognizing that Sen was inspired by a sincere  regard for their ultimate benefit , and was not merely using them for  his own advancement . So assiduously did they devote themselves to their  allotted tasks , that in a very short space

Then said  Merlin to the king--  "" I pray , Lord , that workmen may be ordered to dig deep down into the  ground till they shall come to a great pool of water . ""  This then was done , and the pool discovered far beneath the surface of the  ground .  Then , turning again to the magicians , Merlin said , "" Tell me now , false  sycophants , what there is underneath that pool?""--but they were silent .  Then said he to the king , "" Command this pool to be drained , and at the  bottom shall be found two dragons , great and huge , which now are sleeping ,  but which at night awake and fight and tear each other . At their great  struggle all the ground shakes and trembles , and so casts down thy towers ,  which , therefore , never yet could find secure foundations . ""  The king was amazed at these words , but commanded the pool to be forthwith  drained ; and surely at the bottom of it did they presently discover the  two dragons , fast asleep , as Merlin had declared .  But Vortigern sat upon the brink of the pool till night to see what else  would happen .  Then those two dragons , one of which was white , the other red , rose up and  came near one another , and began a sore fight , and cast forth fire with  their breath . But the white dragon had the advantage , and chased the other  to the end of the lake . And he , for grief at his flight , turned back upon  his foe , and renewed the combat , and forced him to retire in turn . But in  the end the red dragon was worsted , and the white dragon disappeared no  man knew where .  When their battle was done , the king desired Merlin to tell him what it  meant . Whereat he , bursting into tears , cried out this prophecy , which  first foretold the coming of King Arthur .  "" Woe to the red dragon ,

I have made a lordly personage tremble , as he sat in his  armchair ... only by talking to him of things concerning the spirit . Two  years ago , on Easter Eve , His Excellency Nil Alexeyovitch , whose  subordinate I was then , wished to hear what I had to say , and sent a  message by Peter Zakkaritch to ask me to go to his private room . ‘ They  tell me you expound the prophecies relating to Antichrist , ’ said he ,  when we were alone . ‘ Is that so ? ’ ‘ Yes , ’ I answered unhesitatingly , and  I began to give some comments on the Apostle ’s allegorical vision . At  first he smiled , but when we reached the numerical computations and  correspondences , he trembled , and turned pale . Then he begged me to  close the book , and sent me away , promising to put my name on the  reward list .

"	" Like so many scenes of childhood , the room of the clocks was sharply  stamped on Betty 's memory , and , as she came into it now , it seemed to  her that nothing had changed . There were the clocks , all round the  walls , of every shape and size , the big clocks with the human faces and  the small , perky clocks . There was the dingy , medium - sized clock that  held the trumpeter . And there , looking at her with just the old  sandy - cat expression in her pale eyes , was Mrs. Oakley .  Even the possession of an income of eighteen million dollars and a  unique collection of clocks can not place a woman above the making of  the obvious remark .  "" How you have grown !

She had been prepared to enter into long explanations , and the  knowledge that these would not be required was very comforting .  "" Do you remember me ? "" she exclaimed .  "" You are the little girl who clapped her hands at the trumpeter , but  you are not little now . ""  "" I 'm not so very big , "" said Betty , smiling . She felt curiously at home ,  and pity for the loneliness of this strange old woman caused her to  forget her own troubles .  "" You look pretty when you smile , "" said Mrs. Oakley thoughtfully . She  continued to look closely at her . "" You are in trouble , "" she said .  Betty met her eyes frankly .  "" Yes , "" she said .  The old woman bent her head over a Sevres china clock , and stroked it  tenderly with her feather duster .  "" Why did you run away ? "" she asked without looking up .

I ’m so surprised to see you ! ” stammered Meg ,  feeling that she was in for a lecture now .  “ That ’s evident , ” returned Aunt March , sitting down . “ But what is  Father ’s friend saying to make you look like a peony ? There ’s mischief  going on , and I insist upon knowing what it is , ” with another rap .  “ We were only talking . Mr. Brooke came for his umbrella , ” began Meg ,  wishing that Mr. Brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house .  “ Brooke ? That boy ’s tutor ? Ah ! I understand now . I know all about it .  Jo blundered into a wrong message in one of your Father ’s letters , and  I made her tell me . You have n’t gone and accepted him , child ? ” cried  Aunt March , looking scandalized .  “ Hush ! He ’ll hear . Sha n’t I call Mother ? ” said Meg , much troubled .  “ Not yet . I ’ve something to say to you , and I must free my mind at  once . Tell me , do you mean to marry this Cook ? If you do , not one penny  of my money ever goes to you . Remember that , and be a sensible girl , ”  said the old lady impressively .  Now Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of  opposition in the gentlest people , and enjoyed doing it . The best of us  have a spice of perversity in us , especially when we are young and in  love . If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John Brooke , she would  probably have declared she could n’t think of it , but as she was  preemptorily ordered not to like him , she immediately made up her mind  that she would . Inclination as well as perversity made the decision  easy , and being already much excited , Meg opposed the old lady with  unusual spirit .  “ I shall marry whom I please , Aunt March , and you can leave your money  to anyone you like , ” she said , nodding her head with a resolute air .  “ Highty - tighty !

"" Oh , were I but fifteen years old ! "" said she . "" I know that I shall love  the world up there , and all the people who live in it . ""  At last she reached her fifteenth year .  "" Well , now you are grown up , "" said the old dowager , her grandmother .  "" Come , and let me adorn you like your sisters . "" And she placed in her  hair a wreath of white lilies , of which every flower leaf was half a  pearl . Then the old lady ordered eight great oysters to attach  themselves to the tail of the princess to show her high rank .  "" But they hurt me so , "" said the little mermaid .  "" Yes , I know ; pride must suffer pain , "" replied the old lady .  Oh , how gladly she would have shaken off all this grandeur and laid  aside the heavy wreath ! The red flowers in her own garden would have  suited her much better . But she could not change herself , so she said  farewell and rose as lightly as a bubble to the surface of the water .  The sun had just set when she raised her head above the waves . The  clouds were tinted with crimson and gold , and through the glimmering  twilight beamed the evening star in all its beauty . The sea was calm ,  and the air mild and fresh . A large ship with three masts lay becalmed  on the water ; only one sail was set , for not a breeze stirred , and the  sailors sat idle on deck or amidst the rigging . There was music and song  on board , and as darkness came on , a hundred colored lanterns were  lighted , as if the flags of all nations waved in the air .  The little mermaid swam close to the cabin windows , and now and then , as  the waves lifted her up , she could look in through glass window - panes  and see a number of gayly dressed people .  Among them , and the most beautiful of all , was a young prince with  large , black eyes . He was sixteen years of age , and his birthday was  being celebrated with great display . The sailors were dancing on deck ,  and when the prince came out of the cabin , more than a hundred rockets

Then the nobles came  to Pwyll , and besought him to put away his wife , because of the great  { 31b } crime which she had done .   But Pwyll answered them , that they had  no cause wherefore they might ask him to put away his wife , save for her  having no children .   "" But children has she now had , therefore will I not  put her away , if she has done wrong , let her do penance for it .

Therefore it is upon the logic rather  than upon the crime that you should dwell . You have degraded what  should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales . ”  It was a cold morning of the early spring , and we sat after breakfast  on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street . A  thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun - coloured houses , and the  opposing windows loomed like dark , shapeless blurs through the heavy  yellow wreaths . Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and  glimmer of china and metal , for the table had not been cleared yet .  Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning , dipping continuously  into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last ,  having apparently given up his search , he had emerged in no very sweet  temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings .  “ At the same time , ” he remarked after a pause , during which he had sat  puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire , “ you can hardly  be open to a charge of sensationalism , for out of these cases which you  have been so kind as to interest yourself in , a fair proportion do not  treat of crime , in its legal sense , at all .

"	"And the wolf and the fox and the owl , and the  great beasts and the small , lift up their voices to acclaim  Wohoon . And there arise the sounds of voices and the stirring of  leaves .  THE REVOLT OF THE HOME GODS  There be three broad rivers of the plain , born before memory or  fable , whose mothers are three grey peaks and whose father was the  storm . There names be Eimës , Zänës , and Segástrion .  And Eimës is the joy of lowing herds ; and Zänës hath bowed his  neck to the yoke of man , and carries the timber from the forest  far up below the mountain ; and Segástrion sings old songs to  shepherd boys , singing of his childhood in a lone ravine and of  how he once sprang down the mountain sides and far away into the  plain to see the world , and of how one day at last he will find  the sea . These be the rivers of the plain , wherein the plain  rejoices . But old men tell , whose fathers heard it from the  ancients , how once the lords of the three rivers of the plain  rebelled against the law of the Worlds , and passed beyond their  boundaries , and joined together and whelmed cities and slew men ,  saying : "" We now play the game of the gods and slay men for our  pleasure , and we be greater than the gods of Pegana . ""  And all the plain was flooded to the hills .  And Eimës , Zänës , and Segástrion sat upon the mountains , and  spread their hands over their rivers that rebelled by their  command .  But the prayer of men going upward found Pegana , and cried in the  ear of the gods : "" There be three home gods who slay us for their  pleasure , and say that they be mightier than Pegana 's gods , and  play Their game with men . ""  Then were all the gods of Pegana very wroth ; but They could not  whelm the lords of the three rivers , because being home gods ,  though small , they were immortal .  And still the home gods spread their hands across their rivers ,  with their fingers wide apart , and the waters rose and rose , and  the voice of their torrent grew louder , crying : "" Are we not Eimës ,  Zänës , and Segástrion ?

"<fairy>  There was a loud commotion when the secret was discovered , and the  Siem looked ashamed and humiliated to find that one so unseemly and  poor was proved to be the lover of his beautiful wife .
"	"The assembly  were awed at the spectacle , and many of them raised their voices in  thanksgiving to the deity whom they considered to have directed the  course of events and brought the guilty to judgement .  The Siem commanded his ministers to pronounce judgement , and they with  one accord proclaimed that he should be burned to death , without the  performance of any rites and that no hand should gather his bones for  burial . In this decision all the throng acquiesced , for such was the  law and the decree .  U Raitong received the verdict with indifference as one who had  long known and become reconciled to his fate , but he asked one boon ,  and that was permission to build his own pyre and play a dirge for  himself . The Siem and the people were astonished to hear him speak in  clear tones instead of the blubbering manner in which he had always  been known to speak . Nobody raised an objection to his request , so  he received permission to build his own pyre and to play his own dirge .  Accordingly on the morrow U Raitong arose early and gathered a great  pile of dry firewood and laid it carefully till the pyre was larger  than the pyres built for the cremation of Siems and the great ones  of the land . After finishing the pyre he returned to his lonely hut  and divested himself of his filthy rags and arrayed himself in the  fine garments which he used to wear in the hours of the night when he  abandoned himself to music ; he then took his sharati in his hand and  sallied forth to his terrible doom . As he marched towards the pyre  he played on his sharati , and the sound of his dirge was carried by  the air to every dwelling in the village , and so beautiful was it and  so enchanting , so full of wild pathos and woe , that it stirred every  heart . People flocked after him , wondering at the changed appearance  of U Raitong and fascinated by the marvellous and mysterious music such  as they had never before heard , which arrested and charmed every ear .  When the procession reached the pyre , U Raitong stooped and lighted  the dry logs without a shudder or a delay . Then once more he began  to play on his sharati and marched three times around the pyre , and  as he marched he played such doleful and mournful melodies that his  hearers raised their voices in a loud wail in sympathy , so that the  wailing and the mourning at the pyre of the unfortunate U Raitong was  more sincere and impressive than the

"	"It was written  in chalk ; and another man had come and had written two words before  it and had recorded the name of his own regiment too . And the writing  remains after these two men are gone , and the lonely house is silent  but for the wind and the things that creak as it blows , the only  message of this deserted house , is this mighty record , this rare line  of history , ill - written : "" Lost by the 156th Wurtemburgers , retaken by  the Bermondsey Butterflies . ""  Two men wrote that sentence between them . And , as with Homer , no one  knows who they were . And ; like Homer , their words were epic .  On An Old Battle - Field  I entered an old battle - field through a garden gate , a pale green  gate by the . Bapaume - Arras road . The cheerful green attracted me in  the deeps of the desolation as an emerald might in a dust - bin . I  entered through that homely garden gate , it had no hinges , no  pillars , it lolled on a heap of stone : I came to it from the road ;  this alone was not battle - field ; the road alone was made and tended  and kept ; all the rest was battle - field , as far as the eye could see .  Over a large whitish heap lay a Virginia creeper , turning a dull  crimson . And the presence of this creeper mourning there in the waste  showed unmistakably that the heap had been a house . All the living  things were gone that had called this white heap Home : the father  would be fighting , somewhere ; the children would have fled , if there  had been time ; the dog would have gone with them , or perhaps , if  there was not time , he served other masters ; the cat would have made  a lair for herself and stalked mice at night through the trenches .  All the live things that we ever consider were gone ; the creeper  alone remained , the only mourner , clinging to fallen stones that had  supported it once .  And I knew by its presence here there had been a house . And by the  texture or composition of the ruin all round I saw that a village had  stood there . There are calamities one does not contemplate , when one  thinks of time and change . Death , passing away , even ruin , are all  the human lot ; but one contemplates ruin as brought by kindly ages ,  coming slowly at last , with lichen and ivy

"	"With trembling hands he pushed back  the sliding door and looked in . What he saw froze the blood in his  veins . The room was full of dead men ’s bones and the walls were  splashed and the floor was covered with human blood . In one corner  skull upon skull rose to the ceiling , in another was a heap of arm  bones , in another a heap of leg bones . The sickening smell made him  faint . He fell backwards with horror , and for some time lay in a heap  with fright on the floor , a pitiful sight . He trembled all over and his  teeth chattered , and he could hardly crawl away from the dreadful spot .  “ How horrible ! ” he cried out . “ What awful den have I come to in my  travels ? May Buddha help me or I am lost . Is it possible that that kind  old woman is really the cannibal goblin ? When she comes back she will  show herself in her true character and eat me up at one mouthful ! ”  With these words his strength came back to him and , snatching up his  hat and staff , he rushed out of the house as fast as his legs could  carry him . Out into the night he ran , his one thought to get as far as  he could from the goblin ’s haunt . He had not gone far when he heard  steps behind him and a voice crying : “ Stop ! stop ! ”  He ran on , redoubling his speed , pretending not to hear . As he ran he  heard the steps behind him come nearer and nearer , and at last he  recognized the old woman ’s voice which grew louder and louder as she  came nearer .  “ Stop ! stop , you wicked man , why did you look into the forbidden room ? ”  The priest quite forgot how tired he was and his feet flew over the  ground faster than ever . Fear gave him strength , for he knew that if  the goblin caught him he would soon be one of her victims . With all his  heart he repeated the prayer to Buddha :  “ Namu Amida Butsu , Namu Amida Butsu . ”  And after him rushed the dreadful old hag , her hair flying in the wind ,  and her face changing with rage into the demon that she was . In her  hand she carried a large blood - stained knife , and she still shrieked  after him , “ Stop ! stop ! ”  At last , when the priest felt he could run no more , the dawn broke ,

"<fantasy>  Perhaps the efforts of poor clumsy Morano to comfort him cheered  Rodriguez and sent him back to the window , perhaps he turned from them  to find comfort of his own ; but , however he came by it , he had a hope  that this was a passing curse that had come on the world , whose welfare  he cared for whether he lived or died , and that looking a little  farther into the future he would see Mother Earth smiling and her  children happy again .
"	"So he looked through the deep - blue luminous  window once more , beyond the battles we know . From this he turned back  shuddering .  Again he saw the Professor smile with his lips , though whether at his  own weakness , or whether with cynical mirth at the fate of the world ,  Rodriguez could not say .  THE FOURTH CHRONICLE  HOW HE CAME TO THE MOUNTAINS OF THE SUN  The Professor said that in curiosity alone had been found the seeds of  all that is needful for our damnation . Nevertheless , he said , if  Rodriguez cared to see more of his mighty art the mysteries of  Saragossa were all at his guest 's disposal .  Rodriguez , sad and horrified though he was , forgot none of his  courtesy . He thanked the Professor and praised the art of Saragossa ,  but his faith in man and his hope for the world having been newly  disappointed , he cared little enough for the things we should care to  see or for any of the amusements that are usually dear to youth .  "" I shall be happy to see anything , señor , "" he said to the Slave of  Orion , "" that is further from our poor Earth , and to study therein and  admire your famous art . ""  The Professor bowed . He drew small curtains over the windows , matching  his cloak . Morano sought a glimpse through the right - hand window before  the curtains covered it . Rodriguez held him back . Enough had been seen  already , he thought , through that window for the peace of mind of the  world : but he said no word to Morano . He held him by the arm , and the  Professor covered the windows . When the little mauve curtains were  drawn it seemed to Rodriguez that the windows behind them disappeared  and were there no more ; but this he only guessed from uncertain  indications .  Then the Professor drew forth his wand and went to his cupboard of  wonder . Thence he brought condiments , oils , and dews of amazement .  These he poured into a vessel that was in the midst of the room , a bowl  of agate standing alone on a table . He lit it and it all welled up in  flame , a low broad flame of the colour of pale emerald . Over this he  waved his wand , which was of exceeding blackness . Morano watched as  children watch the dancer , who goes from village to village when spring  is come , with some new dance out of Asia or some new song.[Footnote : He  does n't , but why

She discovered that she said the same thing to each papa and mamma  who brought a child to her school .  Sara stood near her father and listened while he and Miss Minchin  talked .   She had been brought to the seminary because Lady Meredith 's  two little girls had been educated there , and Captain Crewe had a great  respect for Lady Meredith 's experience .

And that is why  different birds build their nests differently .  KATE CRACKERNUTS  Once upon a time there was a king and a queen , as in many lands have  been . The king had a daughter , Anne , and the queen had one named Kate ,  but Anne was far bonnier than the queen 's daughter , though they loved  one another like real sisters . The queen was jealous of the king 's  daughter being bonnier than her own , and cast about to spoil her beauty .  So she took counsel of the henwife , who told her to send the lassie to  her next morning fasting .  So next morning early , the queen said to Anne , “ Go , my dear , to the  henwife in the glen , and ask her for some eggs . ” So Anne set out , but as  she passed through the kitchen she saw a crust , and she took and munched  it as she went along .  When she came to the henwife 's she asked for eggs , as she had been told  to do ; the henwife said to her , “ Lift the lid off that pot there and  see . ” The lassie did so , but nothing happened . “ Go home to your minnie  and tell her to keep her larder door better locked , ” said the henwife .

And the boy heard , though he did not know he heard , and he looked out  over the black sea with the white foam - horses galloping over it , and far  away he saw a light . And he said to the skipper , his uncle : "" What light  is that ? ""  Then the skipper said : "" All good things defend you , Nigel , from sailing  near that light . It is not mentioned in all charts ; but it is marked  in the old chart I steer by , which was my father 's father 's before me ,  and his father 's father 's before him . It is the light that shines from  the Lone Tower that stands above the Nine Whirlpools . And when my  father 's father was young he heard from the very old man , his  great - great - grandfather , that in that tower an enchanted Princess ,  fairer than the day , waits to be delivered . But there is no deliverance ,  so never steer that way ; and think no more of the Princess , for that is  only an idle tale . But the whirlpools are quite real . ""  So , of course , from that day Nigel thought of nothing else . And as he  sailed hither and thither upon the high seas he saw from time to time  the light that shone out to sea across the wild swirl of the Nine  Whirlpools . And one night , when the ship was at anchor and the skipper  asleep in his bunk , Nigel launched the ship 's boat and steered alone  over the dark sea towards the light . He dared not go very near till  daylight should show him what , indeed , were the whirlpools he had to  dread .  But when the dawn came he saw the Lone Tower standing dark against the  pink and primrose of the East , and about its base the sullen swirl of  black water , and he heard the wonderful roar of it . So he hung off and  on , all that day and for six days besides . And when he had watched seven  days he knew something .

"	"  “ Men , ” said he , “ I will take  counsel . ”   So to the council he went .   And in the council they considered  that if they should refuse this , they were likely to have more shame  rather than to obtain so great an atonement .   They resolved therefore to  accept it , and they returned to the Court in peace .  Then the pavilions and the tents were set in order after the fashion of a  hall ; and they went to meat , and as they had sat at the beginning of the  feast , so sat they there .   And Matholwch and Bendigeid Vran began to  discourse ; and behold it seemed to Bendigeid Vran , while they talked ,  that Matholwch was not so cheerful as he had been before .   And he thought  that the chieftain might be sad , because of the smallness of the  atonement which he had , for the wrong that had been done him .   “ Oh , man , ”  said Bendigeid Vran , “ thou dost not discourse to - night so cheerfully as  thou wast wo nt .   And if it be because of the smallness of the atonement ,  thou shalt add thereunto whatsoever thou mayest choose , and to - morrow I  will pay thee the horses . ”   “ Lord , ” said he , “ Heaven reward thee . ”   “ And  I will enhance the atonement , ” said Bendigeid Vran , “ for I will give unto  thee a cauldron , the property of which is , that if one of thy men be  slain to - day , and be cast therein , to - morrow he will be as well as ever  he was at the best , except that he will not regain his speech . ”   And  thereupon he gave him great thanks , and very joyful was he for that  cause .  And the next morning they paid Matholwch the horses as long as the  trained horses lasted .   And then they journeyed into another commot ,  where they paid him with colts until the whole had been paid , and from  thenceforth that commot was called Talebolion .  And a second night sat they together .   “ My lord , ” said Matholwch , “ whence  hadst thou the cauldron which thou hast given me ? ”   “ I had it of a man  who had been in thy land , ” said he , “ and I would not give it except to  one from there . ”   “ Who was it ? ” asked he .   “ Llassar Llaesgyvnewid ; he  came here

"<fantasy>  _ How Time Sped with Perion _  It is a tale which they narrate in Poictesme , telling of what befell  Perion de la Forêt after he had been ransomed out of heathenry .
"	"They  tell how he took service with the King of Cyprus . And the tale tells  how the King of Cyprus was defeated at sea by the Emir of Arsuf ; and  how Perion came unhurt from that battle , and by land relieved the  garrison at Japhe , and was ennobled therefor ; and was afterward called  the Comte de la Forêt .  Then the King of Cyprus made peace with heathendom , and Perion left  him . Now Perion 's skill in warfare was leased to whatsoever lord would  dare contend against Demetrios and the proconsul 's magic sword  Flamberge : and Perion of the Forest did not inordinately concern  himself as to the merits of any quarrel because of which battalions  died , so long as he fought toward Melicent . Demetrios was pleased , and  thrilled with the heroic joy of an athlete who finds that he  unwittingly has grappled with his equal .  So the duel between these two dragged on with varying fortunes , and the  years passed , and neither duellist had conquered as yet . Then King  Theodoret , third of that name to rule , and once ( as you have heard ) a  wooer of Dame Melicent , declared a crusade ; and Perion went to him at  Lacre Kai . It was in making this journey , they say , that Perion passed  through Pseudopolis , and had speech there with Queen Helen , the delight  of gods and men : and Perion conceded this Queen was well - enough to look  at .  "" She reminds me , indeed , of that Dame Melicent whom I serve in this  world , and trust to serve in Paradise , "" said Perion . "" But Dame Melicent  has a mole on her left cheek . ""  "" That is a pity , "" said an attendant lord . "" A mole disfigures a pretty  woman . ""  "" I was speaking , messire , of Dame Melicent . ""  "" Even so , "" the lord replied , "" a mole is a blemish . ""  "" I can not permit these observations , "" said Perion . So they fought , and  Perion killed his opponent , and left Pseudopolis that afternoon .  Such was Perion 's way .  He came unhurt to King Theodoret , who at once recognised in the famous  Comte de la Forêt the former Vicomte de Puysange , but gave no sign of  such recognition .  "" Heaven chooses its own instruments , "" the pious King reflected : "" and  this swaggering Comte de la Forêt , who affects so many names has also  the name of being a warrior without any peer in Christendom

"<fantasy>   The complaisant Emir  immediately gave orders for a table to be placed in the shade of the  willows .
"	"  The first service consisted of fish , which they drew from a  river flowing over sands of gold at the foot of a lofty hill ; these were  broiled as fast as taken , and served up with a sauce of vinegar , and  small herbs that grow on Mount Sinai ; for everything with the Emir was  excellent and pious .  The dessert was not quite set on when the sound of lutes from the hill  was repeated by the echoes of the neighbouring mountains .   The Caliph ,  with an emotion of pleasure and surprise , had no sooner raised up his  head than a handful of jasmine dropped on his face ; an abundance of  tittering succeeded the frolic , and instantly appeared through the bushes  the elegant forms of several young females , skipping and bounding like  roes .   The fragrance diffused from their hair struck the sense of Vathek ,  who , in an ecstasy , suspending his repast , said to Bababalouk :  “ Are the Peris come down from their spheres ?   Note her in particular  whose form is so perfect , venturously running on the brink of the  precipice , and turning back her head , as regardless of nothing but the  graceful flow of her robe ; with what captivating impatience doth she  contend with the bushes for her veil ! could it be she who threw the  jasmine at me ? ”  “ Ay ! she it was ; and you too would she throw from the top of the rock , ”  answered Bababalouk ; “ for that is my good friend Nouronihar , who so  kindly lent me her swing ; my dear lord and master , ” added he , twisting a  twig that hung by the rind from a willow , “ let me correct her for want of  respect ; the Emir will have no reason to complain , since ( bating what I  owe to his piety ) he is much to be censured for keeping a troop of girls  on the mountains , whose sharp air gives their blood too brisk a  circulation . ”  “ Peace , blasphemer ! ” said the Caliph ; “ speak not thus of her who over her  mountains leads my heart a willing captive ; contrive rather that my eyes  may be fixed upon hers , that I may respire her sweet breath , as she  bounds panting along these delightful wilds ! ”   On saying these words ,  Vathek extended his arms towards the hill , and directing his eyes with an  anxiety unknown to him before , endeavoured to keep within view the object  that enthralled his soul ; but her course was as difficult to

The pictures finished , he caused them to  be carefully conveyed to the office , and then , sitting down , spent  many hours in composing the following letter , to be sent to Tien ,  accompanying a copy of the printed leaves wherein the story and his  drawing should appear :  “ When the light has for a period been hidden from a person , it is  no uncommon thing for him to be struck blind on gazing at the sun ;  therefore , if the sublime Tien values the eyes of Kin Yen , let her hide  herself behind a gauze screen on his approach .  “ The trembling words of Tien have sunk deep into the inside of Kin Yen  and become part of his being . Never again can he depict persons of the  quality and in the position he was wo nt to do .  “ With this he sends his latest efforts . In each case he conceives his  drawings to be the pictures of the written words ; in the noble Tien ’s  case it is undoubtedly so , in his own he aspires to it . Doubtless the  unobtrusive Tien would make no claim to the character and manner of  behaving of the one in the story , yet Kin Yen confidently asserts that  she is to the other as the glove is to the hand , and he is filled with  the most intelligent delight at being able to exhibit her in her true  robes , by which she will be known to all who see her , in spite of her  dignified protests .

For  the Sea - eagle was sorry that his faring - fellow was hapless , and was sorry  that he was sorry ; and as for the damsel , she had not known but that she  was leading the goodly Spearman to the fulfilment of his heart 's desire .  Albeit after a while she spake again and said :  "" Dear friends , day is gone and night is at hand ; now to - night it were ill  lodging at yonder house ; and the next house on our backward road is over  far for wayworn folk .   But hard by through the thicket is a fair little  wood - lawn , by the lip of a pool in the stream wherein we may bathe us to-  morrow morning ; and it is grassy and flowery and sheltered from all winds  that blow , and I have victual enough in my wallet .   Let us sup and rest  there under the bare heaven , as oft is the wo nt of us in this land ; and  on the morrow early we will arise and get us back again to Wood - end ,  where yet the King abideth , and there shalt thou talk to him again , O  Spearman .

"<fantasy> And he was afraid of their camels with  those light guns on board , he had heard they could do seven knots and  keep it up most of the day and if as much as one shot struck the  mainmast ... and Shard taking his mind off useless fears worked out on  his chart when the Arabs were likely to overtake them .
"	"He told his men  that the wind would hold good for a week , and , gipsy or no , he  certainly knew as much about the wind as is good for a sailor to know .  Alone in his chart - room he worked it out like this , mark two hours to  the good for surprise and finding the tracks and delay in starting ,  say three hours if the guns were mounted in their epaulments , then the  Arabs should start at seven . Supposing the camels go twelve hours a  day at seven knots they would do eighty - four knots a day , while Shard  doing three knots from ten to four , and four knots the rest of the  time , was doing ninety and actually gaining . But when it came to it he  would n't risk more than two knots at night while the enemy were out of  sight , for he rightly regarded anything more than that as dangerous  when sailing on land at night , so he too did eighty - four knots a day .  It was a pretty race . I have not troubled to see if Shard added up his  figures wrongly or if he under - rated the pace of camels , but whatever  it was the Arabs gained slightly , for on the fourth day Spanish Jack ,  five knots astern on what they called the cutter , sighted the camels a  very long way off and signalled the fact to Shard . They had left their  cavalry behind as Shard supposed they would . The wind held good , they  had still two oxen left and could always eat their "" cutter "" , and they  had a fair , though not ample , supply of water , but the appearance of  the Arabs was a blow to Shard for it showed him that there was no  getting away from them , and of all things he dreaded guns . He made  light of it to the men : said they would sink the lot before they had  been in action half an hour : yet he feared that once the guns came up  it was only a question of time before his rigging was cut or his  steering gear disabled .  One point the Desperate Lark scored over the Arabs and a very good one  too , darkness fell just before they could have sighted her and now  Shard used the lantern ahead as he dared not do on the first night  when the Arabs were close , and with the help of it managed to do three  knots . The Arabs encamped in the evening and the Desperate Lark gained  twenty knots . But the next evening they appeared again

Meg had an extra row of  little curlpapers across her forehead , Jo had copiously anointed her  afflicted face with cold cream , Beth had taken Joanna to bed with her  to atone for the approaching separation , and Amy had capped the climax  by putting a clothespin on her nose to uplift the offending feature . It  was one of the kind artists use to hold the paper on their drawing  boards , therefore quite appropriate and effective for the purpose it  was now being put . This funny spectacle appeared to amuse the sun , for  he burst out with such radiance that Jo woke up and roused her sisters  by a hearty laugh at Amy ’s ornament .  Sunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party , and soon a  lively bustle began in both houses . Beth , who was ready first , kept  reporting what went on next door , and enlivened her sisters ’ toilets by  frequent telegrams from the window .  “ There goes the man with the tent ! I see Mrs. Barker doing up the lunch  in a hamper and a great basket . Now Mr. Laurence is looking up at the  sky and the weathercock . I wish he would go too .

"<fantasy>   I had noticed when I came to the spring how the comet which  was killing us hung poised exactly upon the point of a distant hill .
"	"If  he had passed his horrible meridian , if he was going from us , if he  sunk but a hair 's breadth before that seventh drop should fall , I could  tell it would mean salvation .  But the fourth drop fell , and he was big as ever .   The fifth drop fell ,  and a hot , pleasing nose was thrust into my hand , and looking down I  saw a grey wolf had dragged herself across the court and was asking  with eloquent eyes for the help I could not give .   The sixth drop  gathered , and fell ; already the seventh was like a seedling pearl in  its place . The dying wolf yanked affectionately at my hand , but I put  her by and undid my tunic .   Big and bright that drop hung to the spout  lip ; another minute and it would fall .   A beautiful drop , I laughed ,  peering closely at it , many - coloured , prismatic , flushing red and pink ,  a tiny living ruby , hanging by a touch to the green rim above ; enough !  enough !   The quiver of an eyelash would unhinge it now ; and angry with  the life I already felt was behind me , and turning in defiant  expectation to the new to come , I rose , saw the red gleam of my sword  jutting like a fiery spear from the cracking soil where I had planted  it , then looked once more at the drop and glanced for the last time at  the sullen red terror on the hill .  Were my eyes dazed , my senses reeling ?   I said a space ago that the  meteor stood exactly on the mountain - top and if it sunk a hair 's  breadth I should note it ; and now , why , there WAS a flaw in its lower  margin , a flattening of the great red foot that before had been round  and perfect . I turned my smarting eyes away a minute,--saw the seventh  drop fall with a melodious tingle into the cup , then back again,--there  was no mistake -- the truant fire was a fraction less , it had shrunk a  fraction behind the hill even since I looked , and thereon all my life  ran back into its channels , the world danced before me , and "" Heru ! "" I  shouted hoarsely , reeling back towards the palace , "" Heru , ' tis well ;  the worst is past ! ""  But the little princess was unconscious , and at her feet was poor Si ,  quite dead , still reclining with her head in her hands just as

But  just then from some tower high up in the air came the sound of silvery  chimes playing a sweet clear tune , that sounded to my unaccustomed ears  like the song of the first blackbird in the spring , and called a rush of  memories to my mind , some of bad times , some of good , but all sweetened  now into mere pleasure .
"	" "" No more questions now before dinner , "" said Clara ; and she took my hand  as an affectionate child would , and led me out of the room and down  stairs into the forecourt of the Museum , leaving the two Hammonds to  follow as they pleased .  We went into the market - place which I had been in before , a thinnish  stream of elegantly { 1 } dressed people going in along with us .   We turned  into the cloister and came to a richly moulded and carved doorway , where  a very pretty dark - haired young girl gave us each a beautiful bunch of  summer flowers , and we entered a hall much bigger than that of the  Hammersmith Guest House , more elaborate in its architecture and perhaps  more beautiful .   I found it difficult to keep my eyes off the  wall - pictures ( for I thought it bad manners to stare at Clara all the  time , though she was quite worth it ) .   I saw at a glance that their  subjects were taken from queer old - world myths and imaginations which in  yesterday 's world only about half a dozen people in the country knew  anything about ; and when the two Hammonds sat down opposite to us , I said  to the old man , pointing to the frieze :  "" How strange to see such subjects here ! ""  "" Why ? "" said he .   "" I do n't see why you should be surprised ; everybody  knows the tales ; and they are graceful and pleasant subjects , not too  tragic for a place where people mostly eat and drink and amuse  themselves , and yet full of incident . ""  I smiled , and said : "" Well , I scarcely expected to find record of the  Seven Swans and the King of the Golden Mountain and Faithful Henry , and  such curious pleasant imaginations as Jacob Grimm got together from the  childhood of the world , barely lingering even in his time : I should have  thought you would have forgotten such childishness by this time . ""  The old man smiled , and said nothing ; but Dick turned rather red , and  broke out :  "" What _ do _ you mean , guest ?   I think them very beautiful , I mean not only  the pictures , but the stories ; and when we were children we used to  imagine them going on in every wood - end , by the bight of every stream :  every house in the fields was the Fairyland King 's House to us .

And so sore did his past grief  and his desire move him , that he was weak before her , and held down his  hands and let her do .
"	"  And both those were breathless with wonder and joy  and longing ; and they stood aloof a little in a while and looked on each  other , she with heaving bosom and streaming eyes , and he with arms  stretched forth and lips that strove with his heart ’s words and might not  utter them ; but once more she gave herself to him , and he took her in his  arms strongly now , so that she was frail and weak before him , and he laid  his cheek to her cheek and his lips to her lips , and kissed her eyes and  her shoulders and murmured over her .   And then again they stood apart ,  and she took him by the hand and led him to the settle , and set him down  by her , and herself by him ; and a while they said nought .   Then she spake  as one who had come to herself and was calm , though her heart was aflame  for love : Tell me , love , when thine hand was on the latch didst thou look  to find me here in this house ? for thine hand it was that waked me ; I  heard not thy foot before the threshold , for I was weary and slumbering .  Alas ! that I lost the sound of thy feet !   He spake , and his voice sounded  false unto him , as if it came from another ’s mouth : I wot not ; the woman  that led me nearby seemed to bid me hope .   Then he said : Nay , the sooth  is that I should have died if I had not found thee here ; I have been sick  so long with hoping .  Again were they silent till she said : I would that I had heard thee  crossing the brook .   But the wood - wife bade me look for thee no earlier  than to - morrow ; else had I time enough ; and I would have made the house  trim with the new green boughs , and dighted our bed with rose blooms ; and  I would have done on me my shining gown that the wood - wife gave me .   For  indeed she was but clad in her scanty smock and nought else .  But he laid his head on her bosom and kissed her all about , and said :  Nay , my own love , it is well , it is better .

"	" But though I was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one  leg , I was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who  knew him . There were nights when he took a deal more rum and water  than his head would carry ; and then he would sometimes sit and sing his  wicked , old , wild sea - songs , minding nobody ; but sometimes he would call  for glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his  stories or bear a chorus to his singing . Often I have heard the house  shaking with “ Yo - ho - ho , and a bottle of rum , ” all the neighbours joining  in for dear life , with the fear of death upon them , and each singing  louder than the other to avoid remark . For in these fits he was the most  overriding companion ever known ; he would slap his hand on the table for  silence all round ; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question ,  or sometimes because none was put , and so he judged the company was not  following his story . Nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he  had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed .  His stories were what frightened people worst of all . Dreadful stories  they were -- about hanging , and walking the plank , and storms at sea , and  the Dry Tortugas , and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main . By his  own account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men  that God ever allowed upon the sea , and the language in which he told  these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the  crimes that he described . My father was always saying the inn would be  ruined , for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over  and put down , and sent shivering to their beds ; but I really believe his  presence did us good . People were frightened at the time , but on looking  back they rather liked it ; it was a fine excitement in a quiet country  life , and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to  admire him , calling him a “ true sea - dog ” and a “ real old salt ” and  such like names , and saying there was the sort of man that made England  terrible at sea .  In one way , indeed , he bade fair to ruin us , for he kept on staying week  after week , and at last month after

Deemest thou that thou wilt slay me as lightly as  the dun deer , and thou with thy bow unstrung at thy back ?   Now shall I  show thee a trick of fence ; but fear not that I shall hurt thee to spoil  thee .
"	" He advanced on her with his staff aloft , and her heart failed her , and  she quaked , and lightly he beat down her guard and did the sword out of  her hand ; and again he turned on her to take her , but she sprang aside  and ran from him , but ran landward perforce , as he was betwixt her and  the boat ; and he followed heavily , and had nought to do in the race .  But she had not gone a two - score yards ere she heard a great shout , and  another man came running over the meadow ; a slim young man was this , and  worse of attire than the old carle , for so tattered was his raiment that  he was half naked ; but he was goodly of fashion , fresh - coloured and  black - haired .   Birdalone stayed her feet when she saw him , for though she  doubted not to outrun him , yet whither should she run , since her ferry  was behind her ?  So the young man came up to her , and the old carle met him all panting ,  and the young man said : How now , Antony ! what battle is this ? and  wherefore art thou chasing this fair knight ?   And thou , fair sir , why  fleest thou this grey dastard ?  Said Antony : Thou art but a young fool , Otter , this is no man , but a  woman , and I have taken her , and she is mine .  Well , said Otter , I say she is as much mine as thine ; nay , more , if she  will give herself unto me .   But if she will not , she shall go whither she  will in thy despite .   Or art thou a woman ?  Yea , yea , said Birdalone ; and I pray thee , by thy mother ’s head , suffer  me to depart ; for heavy and full of need is the errand that I am about .  Go thou shalt then , said Otter ; lead back to thy place , and I will walk  with thee .   So did they : and Birdalone went beside the young man quaking ;  but he put out no hand unto her ; and sooth to say , she deemed that she  had seldom seen so fair a young man , but it were Arthur or Hugh .  Now he , as Antony , was girt with a short sword , but he let it be in its  sheath ; and as they went , Antony drew his blade again , and hove it up to  smite Otter ,

But you , dear neighbour ; it seems to me stranger that  you should know the upper river , than that I should not know it ; for , as  I understand , you have only been in England a few days .   But perhaps you  mean that you have read about it in books , and seen pictures of  it?--though that does not come to much , either . ""  "" Truly , "" said I.

The Crown of Life is not lodged in the sun : the wise gods have buried it  deeply where the thoughtful will not find it , nor the good : but the Gay  Ones , the Adventurous Ones , the Careless Plungers , they will bring it to  the wise and astonish them . All things are seen in the light -- How shall  we value that which is easy to see ? But the precious things which  are hidden , they will be more precious for our search : they will be  beautiful with our sorrow : they will be noble because of our desire for  them . Come away with me , Shepherd Girl , through the fields , and we will  be careless and happy , and we will leave thought to find us when it can ,  for that is the duty of thought , and it is more anxious

"<fantasy>  Over the wall could be heard the shouts and threats of the army of Twi ,  who were seeking a way to get at the fugitives ; but for the present our  friends knew themselves to be perfectly safe , and they could afford to  laugh at the fury of the entire population of Twi .
"	" 18 .   The Rescue of the High Ki  After several days of siege Prince Marvel began to feel less confident  of the safety of his little party .   The frantic Ki - Ki had built double  battering - rams and were trying to batter down the high wall ; and they  had built several pairs of long ladders with which to climb over the  wall ; and their soldiers were digging two tunnels in the ground in  order to crawl under the wall .  Not at once could they succeed , for the wall was strong and it would  take long to batter it down ; and Nerle stood on top of the wall and  kicked over the ladders as fast as the soldiers of Twi set them up ; and  the gray - bearded Ki stood in the garden holding two big flat boards  with which to whack the heads of any who might come through the tunnels .  But Prince Marvel realized that the perseverance of his foes might win  in the end , unless he took measures to defeat them effectually .   So he  summoned swift messengers from among the Sound Elves , who are  accustomed to travel quickly , and they carried messages from him to  Wul - Takim , the King of the Reformed Thieves , and to King Terribus of  Spor , who had both promised him their assistance in case he needed it .  The prince did not tell his friends of this action , but after the  messengers had been dispatched he felt easier in his mind .  The little High Ki remained as sweet and brave and lovable as ever ,  striving constantly to cheer and encourage her little band of  defenders .   But none of them was very much worried , and Nerle confided  to the maiden in yellow the fact that he expected to suffer quite  agreeably when the Ki - Ki at last got him in their clutches .  Finally a day came when two big holes were battered through the wall ,  and then the twin soldiers of Twi poured through the holes and began to  pound on the doors of the palace itself , in which Prince Marvel and  Nerle , the Ki and the yellow High Ki had locked themselves as securely  as possible .  The prince now decided it was high time for his friends to come to  their rescue ; but they did not appear , and before long the doors of the  palace gave way and the soldiers rushed upon them in a vast throng .  Nerle wanted to fight , and to slay as many of the Twi people as  possible ; but the prince would not let him .  ""

"<fantasy> She said she adored sweets , and she used to insist on my  eating some of them with her ; she liked to compare notes as to how they  tasted while eating them .
"	"I used to get a toothache from them , but I  bore with it although at that time I hated toothache almost as much as  I hated sweets . Then I asked her to come out with me for a walk . She  was willing enough and it was a novel experience for me . Indeed , it was  rather exciting . We went out together often after that , and sometimes  we ’d meet people I knew , young men from my office or from other offices .  I used to be shy when some of these people winked at me as they saluted .  It was pleasant , too , telling the girl who they were , their business and  their salaries : for there was little I did n’t know . I used to tell her  of my own position in the office and what the chief said to me through  the day . Sometimes we talked of the things that had appeared in the  evening papers . A murder perhaps , some phase of a divorce case , the  speech a political person had made , or the price of stock . She was  interested in anything so long as it was talk . And her own share in the  conversation was good to hear . Every lady that passed us had a hat that  stirred her to the top of rapture or the other pinnacle of disgust .  She told me what ladies were frights and what were ducks . Under her  scampering tongue I began to learn something of humanity , even though  she saw most people as delightfully funny clowns or superb , majestical  princes , but I noticed that she never said a bad word of a man , although  many of the men she looked after were ordinary enough . Until I went  walking with her I never knew what a shop window was . A jeweller ’s  window especially : there were curious things in it . She told me how a  tiara should be worn , and a pendant , and she explained the kind of studs  I should wear myself ; they were made of gold and had red stones in them ;  she showed me the ropes of pearl or diamonds that she thought would look  pretty on herself : and one day she said that she liked me very much . I  was pleased and excited that day , but I was a business man and I said  very little in reply . I never liked a pig in a poke .  “ She used to go out two nights in the week , Monday and Thursday , dressed  in her best clothes . I did n’t know where she went , and I did n’t

Billy came presently to the opening in the hedge and stared at the  deserted bench . He was undeniably in a temper . But , then , how becoming  it was ! thought someone .  "" Miss Hugonin ! "" he said , coldly .  Evidently ( thought someone ) he intends to be just as nasty as  possible .  "" Peggy ! "" said Mr. Woods , after a little .  Perhaps ( thought someone ) he wo n't be _ very _ nasty .  "" Dear Peggy ! "" said Mr. Woods , in his most conciliatory tone .  Someone rearranged her hair complacently .  But there was no answer , save the irresponsible chattering of the  birds , and with a sigh Billy turned upon his heel .  Then , by the oddest chance in the world , Margaret coughed .  I dare say it was damp in the summer - house ; or perhaps it was caused  by some passing bronchial irritation ; or perhaps , incredible as it may  seem , she coughed to show him where she was . But I scarcely think so ,  because Margaret insisted afterward -- very positively , too -- that she  did n't cough at all .  XXII  "" Well ! "" Mr. Woods observed , lengthening the word somewhat .  In the intimate half - light of the summer - house , he loomed prodigiously  big . He was gazing downward in careful consideration of three fat  tortoise - shell pins and a surprising quantity of gold hair , which was  practically all that he could see of Miss Hugonin 's person ; for that  young lady had suddenly become a limp mass of abashed violet ruffles ,  and had discovered new and irresistible attractions in the mosaics  about her feet .  Billy 's arms were crossed on his breast and his right hand caressed  his chin meditatively . By and bye , "" I wonder , now , "" he reflected ,  aloud , "" if you can give any reason -- any possible reason -- why you  should n't be locked up in the nearest sanatorium ?

Through generation by generation , traversing just three centuries , I have  explained to you , my dear Mrs. Grundy , how divers weddings came about :  and each marriage appears , upon the whole , to have resulted  satisfactorily .

But now we reach the annals of the house of Musgrave : and further  adventuring is blocked by R. V. Musgrave 's monumental work _ The Musgraves  of Matocton _ . The critical may differ as to the plausibility of the  family tradition ( ably defended by Colonel Musgrave , pp . 33 - 41 ) that  Mistress Cynthia Musgrave was the dark lady of Shakespeare 's Sonnets , and  that this poet , also , in the end , absolved her of intentional malice .

"	""" Pendu ""  he said . Yes , I agreed .  It was all right . The old man almost smiled .  I offered him a cigarette and we lit two from an apparatus of flint  and steel and petrol that the old man had in his pocket .  He showed me a photograph of himself and a passport to prove , I  suppose , that he was not a spy . One could not recognize the likeness ,  for it must have been taken on some happier day , before he had seen  his house of two storeys lying there by the road . But he was no spy ,  for there were tears in his eyes ; and Prussians I think have no tears  for what we saw across the village of Croisilles .  I spoke of the rebuilding of his house no more , I spoke no more of  the new Croisilles shining through future years ; for these were not  the things that he saw in the future , and these were not the hopes of  the poor old man . He had one dark hope of the future , and no others .  He hoped to see the Kaiser hung for the wrong he had done to  Croisilles . It was for this hope he lived .  Madame or señor of whatever far country , who may chance to see these  words , blame not this old man for the fierce hope he cherished . It  was the only hope he had . You , Madame , with your garden , your house ,  your church , the village where all know you , you may hope as a  Christian should , there is wide room for hope in your future . You  shall see the seasons move over your garden , you shall busy yourself  with your home , and speak and share with your neighbours innumerable  small joys , and find consolation and beauty , and at last rest , in and  around the church whose spire you see from your home . You , señor ,  with your son perhaps growing up , perhaps wearing already some sword  that you wore once , you can turn back to your memories or look with  hope to the future with equal ease .  The man that I met in Croisilles had none of these things at all . He  had that one hope only .  Do not , I pray you , by your voice or vote , or by any power or  influence that you have , do anything to take away from this poor old  Frenchman the only little hope he has left .

"<fantasy> Most of his time was spent in  reading the sacred books , and at an early age he found the worship of  apes to be repulsive to his gentle nature , and resolved to break through  the venerable traditions of his family by devoting his time to literary  pursuits , and presenting himself for the public examinations at Canton .
"	" In this his resolution was strengthened by a rumour that an army of  bowmen was shortly to be raised from the Province in which he lived ,  so that if he remained he would inevitably be forced into an occupation  which was even more distasteful to him than the one he was leaving .  Having arrived at Canton , Ling ’s first care was to obtain particulars of  the examinations , which he clearly perceived , from the unusual  activity displayed on all sides , to be near at hand . On inquiring from  passers - by , he received very conflicting information ; for the persons to  whom he spoke were themselves entered for the competition , and therefore  naturally misled him in order to increase their own chances of success .  Perceiving this , Ling determined to apply at once , although the light  was past , to a Mandarin who was concerned in the examinations , lest by  delay he should lose his chance for the year .  “ It is an unfortunate event that so distinguished a person should have  selected this day and hour on which to overwhelm us with his affable  politeness ! ” exclaimed the porter at the gate of the Yamen , when Ling  had explained his reason for going . “ On such a day , in the reign of the  virtuous Emperor Hoo Chow , a very benevolent and unassuming ancestor of  my good lord the Mandarin was destroyed by treachery , and ever since his  family has observed the occasion by fasting and no music . This person  would certainly be punished with death if he entered the inner room from  any cause . ”  At these words , Ling , who had been simply brought up , and chiefly in the  society of apes , was going away with many expressions of self - reproach  at selecting such a time , when the gate - keeper called him back .  “ I am overwhelmed with confusion at the position in which I find  myself , ” he remarked , after he had examined his mind for a short time .  “ I may meet with an ungraceful and objectionable death if I carry out  your estimable instructions , but I shall certainly merit and receive  a similar fate if I permit so renowned and versatile a person to leave  without a fitting reception . In such matters a person can only trust to  the intervention of good spirits ; if , therefore , you will permit this  unworthy individual to wear , while making the venture , the ring which he  perceives upon your finger , and which he recognizes as a very powerful  charm against evil , misunderstandings , and extortion ,

Make it last as  long as you can , for it is n’t very plenty , you know . ”  “ Oh , thank you ! It must be so nice to have pocket money ! I ’ll have a  grand feast , for I have n’t tasted a lime this week . I felt delicate  about taking any , as I could n’t return them , and I ’m actually suffering  for one . ”  Next day Amy was rather late at school , but could not resist the  temptation of displaying , with pardonable pride , a moist brown - paper  parcel , before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk .  During the next few minutes the rumor that Amy March had got  twenty - four delicious limes ( she ate one on the way ) and was going to  treat circulated through her ‘ set ’ , and the attentions of her friends  became quite overwhelming . Katy Brown invited her to her next party on  the spot . Mary Kingsley insisted on lending her her watch till recess ,  and Jenny Snow , a satirical young lady , who had basely twitted Amy upon  her limeless state , promptly buried the hatchet and offered to furnish  answers to certain appalling sums . But Amy had not forgotten Miss  Snow ’s cutting remarks about ‘ some persons whose noses were not too  flat to smell other people ’s limes , and stuck - up people who were not  too proud to ask for them ’ , and she instantly crushed ‘ that Snow  girl ’s ’ hopes by the withering telegram , “ You need n’t be so polite all  of a sudden , for you wo n’t get any . ”  A distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning ,  and Amy ’s beautifully drawn maps received praise , which honor to her  foe rankled in the soul of Miss Snow , and caused Miss March to assume  the airs of a studious young peacock . But , alas , alas ! Pride goes  before a fall , and the revengeful Snow turned the tables with  disastrous success . No sooner had the guest paid the usual stale  compliments and bowed himself out , than Jenny , under pretense of asking  an important question , informed Mr. Davis , the teacher , that Amy March  had pickled limes in her desk .  Now Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article , and

"	"Then one by one all made the farewell sign  before they turned to go , and as they did this a herald unseen in the  dark was speeding towards them .  After a long silence the King spake :  “ Prophets of my Kingdom , ” he said , “ you have not prophesied alike , and  the words of each prophet condemn his fellows ’ words so that wisdom may  not be discovered among prophets . But I command that none in my Kingdom  shall doubt that the earliest King of Zarkandhu stored wine beneath  this palace before the building of the city or ever the palace arose ,  and I shall cause commands to be uttered for the making of a banquet at  once within this Hall , so that ye shall perceive that the power of my  wine is greater than all your spells , and dancing more wondrous than  prophecy . ”  The dancers and the winebearers were summoned back , and as the night  wore on a banquet was spread and all the prophets bidden to be seated ,  Samahn , Ynath , Monith , Ynar Thun , the prophet of Journeys , Zornadhu ,  Yamen , Paharn , Ilana , Ulf , and one that had not spoken nor yet revealed  his name , and who wore his prophet ’s cloak across his face .  And the prophets feasted as they were commanded and spake as other men  spake , save he whose face was hidden , who neither ate nor spake . Once  he put out his hand from under his cloak and touched a blossom among  the flowers upon the table and the blossom fell .  And Pattering Leaves came in and danced again , and the King smiled , and  Pattering Leaves was happy though she had not the wisdom of the  prophets . And in and out , in and out , in and out among the columns of  the Hall went Summer Lightning in the maze of the dance . And Silvern  Fountain bowed before the King and danced and danced and bowed again ,  and old Intahn went to and fro from the cavern to the King gravely  through the midst of the dancers but with kindly eyes , and when the  King had often drunk of the old wine of the elder Kings he called for  Dream of the Sea and bade her sing . And Dream of the Sea came through  the arches and sang of an island builded by magic out of pearls , that  lay set in a ruby sea , and how it lay far off and under the south ,  guarded by jagged reefs whereon the sorrows of the world were wrecked  and never came to the island

"<fairy> And finally , when they got out their pipes and went serenely  puffing around , the very summit of glory was reached .
"	" Tom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now . Glory  was sufficient . He would live for glory . Now that he was distinguished ,  maybe she would be wanting to “ make up . ” Well , let her — she should see  that he could be as indifferent as some other people . Presently she  arrived . Tom pretended not to see her . He moved away and joined a group  of boys and girls and began to talk . Soon he observed that she was  tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes ,  pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates , and screaming with laughter  when she made a capture ; but he noticed that she always made her  captures in his vicinity , and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye  in his direction at such times , too . It gratified all the vicious vanity  that was in him ; and so , instead of winning him , it only “ set him up ”   the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he  knew she was about . Presently she gave over skylarking , and moved  irresolutely about , sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and  wistfully toward Tom . Then she observed that now Tom was talking more  particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else . She felt a sharp pang  and grew disturbed and uneasy at once . She tried to go away , but her  feet were treacherous , and carried her to the group instead . She said to  a girl almost at Tom ’s elbow — with sham vivacity :  “ Why , Mary Austin ! you bad girl , why did n’t you come to Sunday - school ? ”  “ I did come — didn’t you see me ? ”  “ Why , no ! Did you ? Where did you sit ? ”  “ I was in Miss Peters ’ class , where I always go . I saw _ you _ . ”  “ Did you ? Why , it ’s funny I did n’t see you . I wanted to tell you about  the picnic . ”  “ Oh , that ’s jolly .

May 31st , 1889 , is a day that will long be remembered with horror by the  people in the beautiful valley of the Conemaugh , in Pennsylvania . On  that date occurred the terrible disaster which is known to the world and  will be named in history as the "" Johnstown Flood . ""  For many days previous to that date it had been raining hard , and great  floods extended over a vast region of country in Pennsylvania , New York  and the District of Columbia . Never before had there been such a fall of  rain in that region within the memory of the oldest inhabitant . The  waters in the river and creeks of that beautiful valley rose rapidly and  overflowed their banks , while the people looked on in wonder , but  seemingly not in fear . Suddenly there appeared to their wondering gaze a  great bay horse galloping at break - neck speed and bearing a rider who  waved his hands to them and cried : "" South Fork dam will burst . To the  hills for your lives . "" Only a few heeded his words of warning , while  many mocked and jeered . On dashed the rider to warn still others of the  impending danger , and , alas , to be himself and horse dashed to death by  the massive timbers of a falling bridge . South Fork dam did break , and  the mighty waters of Conemaugh Lake were hurled with resistless force  upon the doomed people of that beautiful valley . The terrible details of  the appalling disaster would fill several volumes larger than this . On  rushed the mighty waters , sweeping onward in their flood dwellings ,  churches and buildings of every description , whether of wood , brick or  stone

"" At all events , "" said Freydis , "" it is a queer  thing surely that in the month which is to come the stork will be  fetching your second child to a woman resting under my roof and in my  golden bed . Yes , Thurinel has just been telling me of your plan , and it  is a queer thing . Yet it is a far queerer thing that your first child ,  whom no stork fetched nor had any say in shaping , but whom you made of  clay to the will of your proud youth and in your proud youth 's likeness ,  should be limping about the world somewhere in the appearance of a  strapping tall young fellow , and that you should know nothing about his  doings . ""  "" Ah ! what have you heard ? and what do you know about him , Freydis ?

So Manuel and Niafer remained at Sargyll until the baby should be  delivered . King Ferdinand , then in the midst of another campaign against  the Moors , could do nothing for his vassal just now . But glittering  messengers came from Raymond Bérenger , and from King Helmas , and from  Queen Stultitia , each to discuss this and that possible alliance and aid  by and by . Everybody was very friendly if rather vague . But Manuel for  the present considered only Niafer and the baby that was to come , and he  let statecraft bide .  Then two other ships , that were laden with Duke Asmund 's men , came also ,  in an attempt to capture Manuel : so Freydis despatched a sending which  caused these soldiers to run about the decks howling like wolves , and to  fling away their swords and winged helmets , and to fight one against the  other with hands and teeth until all were slain .

What a wonderful thing for Mrs. Sowerby to think of ! What a kind ,  clever woman she must be ! How good the buns were ! And what delicious  fresh milk !  “ Magic is in her just as it is in Dickon , ” said Colin . “ It makes her  think of ways to do things — nice things . She is a Magic person .

He liked this so much that he improved upon it .  “ Tell her she has been most bounteous and our gratitude is extreme . ”  And then forgetting his grandeur he fell to and stuffed himself with  buns and drank milk out of the pail in copious draughts in the manner  of any hungry little boy who had been taking unusual exercise and  breathing in moorland air and whose breakfast was more than two hours  behind him .  This was the beginning of many agreeable incidents of the same kind .  They actually awoke to the fact that as Mrs. Sowerby had fourteen  people to provide food for she might not have enough to satisfy two  extra appetites every day .

"<fantasy> And the Daleswood men were beginning to  say , ‘ Who would there be to remember it just as it was ? ’  “ There was no gas , the wind being wrong for it , so they were able to  talk , that is if they shouted , for the bullets alone made as much  noise as breaking up an old shed , crisper like , more like new timber  breaking ; and the shells of course was howling all the time , that is  the barrage that was bursting far back .
"	"The trench still stank of  them .  “ They said that one of them must go over and put his hands up , or run  away if he could , whichever he liked , and when the war was over he  would go to some writing fellow , one of those what makes a living by  it , and tell him all about Daleswood , just as it used to be , and he  would write it out proper and there it would be for always . They all  agreed to that . And then they talked a bit , as well as they could  above that awful screeching , to try and decide who it should be . The  eldest , they said , would know Daleswood best . But he said , and they  came to agree with him , that it would be a sort of waste to save the  life of a man what had had his good time , and they ought to send the  youngest , and they would tell him all they knew of Daleswood before  his time , and everything would be written down just the same and the  old time remembered .  “ They had the idea somehow that the women thought more of their own  man and their children and the washing and what - not ; and that the deep  woods and the great hills beyond , and the plowing and the harvest and  snaring rabbits in winter and the sports in the village in summer , and  the hundred things that pass the time of one generation in an old , old  place like Daleswood , meant less to them than the men . Anyhow they did  not quite seem to trust them with the past .  “ The youngest of them was only just eighteen . That was Dick . They  told him to get out and put his hands up and be quick getting across ,  as soon as they had told him one or two things about the old time in  Daleswood that a youngster like him would n’t know .  “ Well , Dick said he was n’t going , and was making trouble about it , so  they told Fred to go . Back , they told him , was best , and come up  behind the Boche with his hands up ; they would be less likely to shoot  when it was back towards their own supports .  “ Fred would n’t go , and so on with the rest . Well , they did n’t waste  time quarrelling , time being scarce , and they said what was to be  done ? There was chalk where they were , low down in the trench , a  little brown

So , while  some were barring the gates , the young devil climbed up , and took down  the flail that had the handstaff and booltheen both made out of red - hot  iron . The little vagabond was grinning to think how it would burn the  hands o ' Tom , but the dickens a burn it made on him , no more nor if it  was a good oak sapling .  "" Thankee , "" says Tom . "" Now would you open the gate for a body , and I 'll  give you no more trouble . ""  "" Oh , tramp ! "" says Ould Nick ; "" is that the way ? It is easier getting  inside them gates than getting out again . Take that tool from him , and  give him a dose of the oil of stirrup .

Well , they rushed at  Tom , but he gave them , little and big , such a thrashing as they did n't  forget for a while .

"	" King Midas hastened back to the palace ; and , I suppose , the servants  knew not what to make of it when they saw their royal master so  carefully bringing home an earthen pitcher of water . But that water ,  which was to undo all the mischief that his folly had wrought , was  more precious to Midas than an ocean of molten gold could have been .  The first thing he did , as you need hardly be told , was to sprinkle it  by handfuls over the golden figure of little Marygold .  No sooner did it fall on her than you would have laughed to see how  the rosy color came back to the dear child 's cheek ! and how she began  to sneeze and sputter!--and how astonished she was to find herself  dripping wet , and her father still throwing more water over her !  "" Pray do not , dear father ! "" cried she . "" See how you have wet my nice  frock , which I put on only this morning ! ""  For Marygold did not know that she had been a little golden statue ;  nor could she remember anything that had happened since the moment  when she ran with outstretched arms to comfort poor King Midas .  Her father did not think it necessary to tell his beloved child how  very foolish he had been , but contented himself with showing how much  wiser he had now grown . For this purpose , he led little Marygold into  the garden , where he sprinkled all the remainder of the water over the  rose - bushes , and with such good effect that above five thousand roses  recovered their beautiful bloom . There were two circumstances ,  however , which , as long as he lived , used to put King Midas in mind of  the Golden Touch . One was , that the sands of the river sparkled like  gold ; the other , that little Marygold 's hair had now a golden tinge ,  which he had never observed in it before she had been transmuted by  the effect of his kiss . This change of hue was really an improvement ,  and made Marygold 's hair richer than in her babyhood .  When King Midas had grown quite an old man , and used to trot  Marygold 's children on his knee , he was fond of telling them this  marvelous story , pretty much as I have now told it to you . And then  would he stroke their glossy ringlets , and tell them that their hair ,  likewise , had a rich shade of gold , which they had inherited from  their mother .  "" And to

"<fairy> He remembered how he had stretched out his arms towards the  beautiful , boundless blue of the horizon , and wept , and wept .
"	"What had  so tormented him was the idea that he was a stranger to all this , that  he was outside this glorious festival .  What was this universe ? What was this grand , eternal pageant to which  he had yearned from his childhood up , and in which he could never take  part ? Every morning the same magnificent sun ; every morning the same  rainbow in the waterfall ; every evening the same glow on the  snow - mountains .  Every little fly that buzzed in the sun ’s rays was a singer in the  universal chorus , “ knew its place , and was happy in it . ” Every blade of  grass grew and was happy . Everything knew its path and loved it , went  forth with a song and returned with a song ; only he knew nothing ,  understood nothing , neither men nor words , nor any of nature ’s voices ;  he was a stranger and an outcast .  Oh , he could not then speak these words , or express all he felt ! He had  been tormented dumbly ; but now it appeared to him that he must have  said these very words — even then — and that Hippolyte must have taken his  picture of the little fly from his tears and words of that time .  He was sure of it , and his heart beat excitedly at the thought , he knew  not why .  He fell asleep on the bench ; but his mental disquiet continued through  his slumbers .  Just before he dozed off , the idea of Hippolyte murdering ten men  flitted through his brain , and he smiled at the absurdity of such a  thought .  Around him all was quiet ; only the flutter and whisper of the leaves  broke the silence , but broke it only to cause it to appear yet more  deep and still .  He dreamed many dreams as he sat there , and all were full of disquiet ,  so that he shuddered every moment .  At length a woman seemed to approach him . He knew her , oh ! he knew her  only too well . He could always name her and recognize her anywhere ;  but , strange , she seemed to have quite a different face from hers , as  he had known it , and he felt a tormenting desire to be able to say she  was not the same woman . In the face before him there was such dreadful  remorse and horror that he thought she must be a criminal , that she  must have just committed some awful crime .  Tears were trembling on her white cheek . She beckoned

""  "" Yea , Lady , "" he said ; "" but the sight of thee maketh me foolish to do  aught else but to look on thee . ""  She said , in a peevish voice : "" Tush , Squire , the day is too far spent for  soft and courtly speeches ; what was good there is nought so good here .  Withal , I know more of thine heart than thou deemest . ""  Walter hung down his head and reddened , and she looked on him , and her  face changed , and she smiled and said , kindly this time : "" Look ye ,  Squire , I am hot and weary , and ill - content ; but presently it will be  better with me ; for my knees have been telling my shoulders that the cold  water of this little lake will be sweet and pleasant this summer noonday ,  and that I shall forget my foil when I have taken my pleasure therein .  Wherefore , go thou with thine hounds without the thicket and there abide  my coming .   And I bid thee look not aback as thou goest , for therein were  peril to thee : I shall not keep thee tarrying long alone . ""  He bowed his head to her , and turned and went his ways .   And now , when he  was a little space away from her , he deemed her indeed a marvel of women ,  and wellnigh forgat all his doubts and fears concerning her , whether she  were a fair image fashioned out of lies and guile , or it might be but an  evil thing in the shape of a goodly woman .   Forsooth , when he saw her  caressing the dear and friendly Maid , his heart all turned against her ,  despite what his eyes and his ears told his mind , and she seemed like as  it were a serpent enfolding the simplicity of the body which he loved .  But now it was all changed , and he lay on the grass and longed for her  coming ; which was delayed for somewhat more than an hour .   Then she came  back to him , smiling and fresh and cheerful , her green gown let down to  her heels .  He sprang up to meet her , and she came close to him , and spake from a  laughing face : "" Squire , hast thou no meat in thy wallet ?   For , meseemeth ,

"<fairy>  Injun Joe ’s bowie - knife lay close by , its blade broken in two .
"	"The great  foundation - beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through , with  tedious labor ; useless labor , too , it was , for the native rock formed a  sill outside it , and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought  no effect ; the only damage done was to the knife itself . But if there  had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless  still , for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have  squeezed his body under the door , and he knew it . So he had only hacked  that place in order to be doing something — in order to pass the weary  time — in order to employ his tortured faculties . Ordinarily one could  find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this  vestibule , left there by tourists ; but there were none now . The prisoner  had searched them out and eaten them . He had also contrived to catch a  few bats , and these , also , he had eaten , leaving only their claws . The  poor unfortunate had starved to death . In one place , near at hand , a  stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages , builded  by the water - drip from a stalactite overhead . The captive had broken off  the stalagmite , and upon the stump had placed a stone , wherein he had  scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once  in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock - tick — a  dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours . That drop was falling  when the Pyramids were new ; when Troy fell ; when the foundations of Rome  were laid ; when Christ was crucified ; when the Conqueror created the  British empire ; when Columbus sailed ; when the massacre at Lexington was  “ news . ”  It is falling now ; it will still be falling when all these things shall  have sunk down the afternoon of history , and the twilight of tradition ,  and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion . Has everything a  purpose and a mission ? Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand  years to be ready for this flitting human insect ’s need ? and has it  another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come ? No  matter . It is many and many a year since the hapless half - breed scooped  out the stone to catch the priceless drops , but to this day the tourist  stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow - dropping water when

"<fairy>  For many months the perturbation of my mind was very great ; in the day  great troubles overwhelmed me , and in the night I dreamed often of  killing savages .
"	"About two years after I first knew these fears , I was  surprised one morning by seeing five canoes on the shore . I could not  tell what to think of it , so went and lay in my castle perplexed and  discomforted . At length , becoming very impatient , I clambered up to the  top of the hill and perceived , by the help of my perspective glass , no  less than thirty men dancing round a fire with barbarous gestures . While  I was looking , two miserable wretches were dragged from the boats . One  was immediately knocked down , while the other , seeing himself a little  at liberty , started away from them and ran along the sands directly  towards me . I was dreadfully frightened , that I must acknowledge , when I  perceived him run my way , especially when , as I thought , I saw him  pursued by the whole body . But my spirits began to recover when I found  that but three men followed him , and that he outstripped them  exceedingly , in running .  Presently he came to a creek and , making nothing of it , plunged in ,  landed , and ran on with exceeding strength . Two of the pursuers swam the  creek , but the third went no farther , and soon after went back again . I  immediately took my two guns , ran down the hill and clapped myself in  the way between the pursuers and the pursued , hallooing aloud to him  that fled . Then , rushing on the foremost of the pursuers , I knocked him  down with the stock of my piece . The other stopped , as if frightened ,  but as I came nearer , I perceived he was fitting a bow and arrow to  shoot at me ; so I was then obliged to shoot at him first , which I did  and killed him .  The poor savage who fled was so frightened with the noise of my piece  that he seemed inclined still to fly . I gave him all the signs of  encouragement I could think of , and he came nearer , kneeling down every  ten or twelve steps . I took him up and made much of him , and comforted  him . Then , beckoning him to follow me , I took him to my cave on the  farther part of the island . Here , having refreshed him , I made signs for  him to lie down to sleep , which the poor creature did .

"	"But in order that the King might not see it , she was to lie  on the side on which she had no eye .  In the evening when he came home and heard that he had a son he was  heartily glad , and was going to the bed of his dear wife to see how she  was . But the old woman quickly called out , “ For your life leave the  curtains closed ; the Queen ought not to see the light yet , and must  have rest . ” The King went away , and did not find out that a false Queen  was lying in the bed .  But at midnight , when all slept , the nurse , who was sitting in the  nursery by the cradle , and who was the only person awake , saw the door  open and the true Queen walk in . She took the child out of the cradle ,  laid it on her arm , and suckled it . Then she shook up its pillow , laid  the child down again , and covered it with the little quilt . And she did  not forget the roebuck , but went into the corner where it lay , and  stroked its back . Then she went quite silently out of the door again .  The next morning the nurse asked the guards whether anyone had come  into the palace during the night , but they answered , “ No , we have seen  no one . ”  She came thus many nights and never spoke a word : the nurse always saw  her , but she did not dare to tell anyone about it .  When some time had passed in this manner , the Queen began to speak in  the night , and said —  “ How fares my child , how fares my roe ?  Twice shall I come , then never more . ”  The nurse did not answer , but when the Queen had gone again , went to  the King and told him all . The King said , “ Ah , heavens ! what is this ?  To - morrow night I will watch by the child . ” In the evening he went into  the nursery , and at midnight the Queen again appeared and said —  “ How fares my child , how fares my roe ?  Once will I come , then never more . ”  And she nursed the child as she was wo nt to do before she disappeared .  The King dared not speak to her , but on the next night he watched  again .

"	"So that first day King Arthur ,  and all the kings and lords that were judges , gave Sir Tristram the  prize ; howbeit they knew him not , but named him the Knight with the  Black Shield .  CHAPTER XXX . How Sir Tristram returned against King Arthur ’s party  because he saw Sir Palomides on that party .  Then upon the morn Sir Palomides returned from the King of Northgalis ,  and rode to King Arthur ’s side , where was King Carados , and the King of  Ireland , and Sir Launcelot ’s kin , and Sir Gawaine ’s kin . So Sir  Palomides sent the damosel unto Sir Tristram that he sent to seek him  when he was out of his mind in the forest , and this damosel asked Sir  Tristram what he was and what was his name ?  As for that , said Sir Tristram , tell Sir Palomides ye shall not wit as  at this time unto the time I have broken two spears upon him . But let  him wit thus much , said Sir Tristram , that I am the same knight that he  smote down in over evening at the tournament ; and tell him plainly on  what party that Sir Palomides be I will be of the contrary party .  Sir , said the damosel , ye shall understand that Sir Palomides will be  on King Arthur ’s side , where the most noble knights of the world be . In  the name of God , said Sir Tristram , then will I be with the King of  Northgalis , because Sir Palomides will be on King Arthur ’s side , and  else I would not but for his sake . So when King Arthur was come they  blew unto the field ; and then there began a great party , and so King  Carados jousted with the King of the Hundred Knights , and there King  Carados had a fall : then was there hurling and rushing , and right so  came in knights of King Arthur ’s , and they bare aback the King of  Northgalis ’ knights .  Then Sir Tristram came in , and began so roughly and so bigly that there  was none might withstand him , and thus Sir Tristram dured long . And at  the last Sir Tristram fell among the fellowship of King Ban , and there  fell upon him Sir Bors de Ganis , and Sir Ector de Maris , and Sir  Blamore de Ganis , and many other knights . And then Sir Tristram smote  on the right hand and on the left hand , that all lords and ladies spake  of his noble deeds . But at the last Sir Tristram should have had

"	"And he put each tongue in the mouth to  which it belonged , and it fitted exactly . Then he took the handkerchief  on which the name of the princess was embroidered , and showed it to the  maiden , and asked to whom she had given it , and she replied , “ To him  who killed the dragon . ” And then he called his animals , and took the  collar off each of them and the golden clasp from the lion , and showed  them to the maiden and asked to whom they belonged . She answered , “ The  necklace and golden clasp were mine , but I divided them among the  animals who helped to conquer the dragon . ” Then spake the huntsman ,  “ When I , tired with the fight , was resting and sleeping , the marshal  came and cut off my head . Then he carried away the King ’s daughter , and  gave out that it was he who had killed the dragon , but that he lied I  prove with the tongues , the handkerchief , and the necklace . ” And then  he related how his animals had healed him by means of a wonderful root ,  and how he had travelled about with them for one year , and had at  length again come there and had learnt the treachery of the marshal by  the inn - keeper ’s story . Then the King asked his daughter , “ Is it true  that this man killed the dragon ? ” And she answered , “ Yes , it is true .  Now can I reveal the wicked deed of the marshal , as it has come to  light without my connivance , for he wrung from me a promise to be  silent . For this reason , however , did I make the condition that the  marriage should not be solemnized for a year and a day . ” Then the King  bade twelve councillors be summoned who were to pronounce judgment on  the marshal , and they sentenced him to be torn to pieces by four bulls .  The marshal was therefore executed , but the King gave his daughter to  the huntsman , and named him his viceroy over the whole kingdom . The  wedding was celebrated with great joy , and the young King caused his  father and his foster - father to be brought , and loaded them with  treasures . Neither did he forget the inn - keeper , but sent for him and  said , “ Behold , sir host , I have married the King ’s daughter , and your  house and yard are mine . ” The host said , “ Yes , according to justice it

"	" But when they came to the bridge where he had left his horse it was  nowhere to be seen , for , though the Prince thought he had been a crab  only a few hours , he had in reality been under the water for more than  ten days . While they were wondering how they should reach his father ’s  court , they saw a splendid coach driven by six gaily caparisoned horses  coming along the bank . In this they drove to the palace . The King and  Queen were at church , weeping for their son , whom they had long mourned  for dead . Great was their delight and astonishment when the Prince  entered , leading the beautiful maiden by the hand . The wedding was at  once celebrated and there was feasting and merry - making throughout the  kingdom for six weeks .  Some time afterward the Prince and his bride were sitting in the garden ,  when a crow said to them : “ Ungrateful creatures ! Have you forgotten the  two poor maidens who helped you in your distress ? Must they spin gold  flax for ever ? Have no pity on the old witch . The three maidens are  princesses , whom she stole away when they were children together , with  all the silver utensils , which she turned into gold flax .

The maidens had dreamed that he was coming , and were ready to go  with him , but first they made a cake in which they put poison , and  left it on a table where the old woman was likely to see it when she  returned .

There were four shrines , dedicated severally  to St. Cosmo , to St. Damianus , to St. Guignole of Brest , and to St.  Foutin de Varailles . In this chapel were a hooded man , clothed in  long garments that were striped with white and yellow , and two naked  children , both girls . One of the children carried a censer : the  other held in one hand a vividly blue pitcher half filled with  water , and in her left hand a cellar of salt .  First of all , the hooded man made Jurgen ready . "" Behold the lance , ""  said the hooded man , "" which must serve you in this adventure . ""  "" I accept the adventure , "" Jurgen replied , "" because I believe the  weapon to be trustworthy . ""  Said the hooded man : "" So be it ! but as you are , so once was I.

"	"”  “ In connection with ‘ the ten , ’ eh ? ” laughed Evgenie , as he left the  room .  An hour later , towards four o’clock , the prince went into the park . He  had endeavoured to fall asleep , but could not , owing to the painful  beating of his heart .  He had left things quiet and peaceful ; the invalid was fast asleep , and  the doctor , who had been called in , had stated that there was no  special danger . Lebedeff , Colia , and Burdovsky were lying down in the  sick - room , ready to take it in turns to watch . There was nothing to  fear , therefore , at home .  But the prince ’s mental perturbation increased every moment . He  wandered about the park , looking absently around him , and paused in  astonishment when he suddenly found himself in the empty space with the  rows of chairs round it , near the Vauxhall . The look of the place  struck him as dreadful now : so he turned round and went by the path  which he had followed with the Epanchins on the way to the band , until  he reached the green bench which Aglaya had pointed out for their  rendezvous . He sat down on it and suddenly burst into a loud fit of  laughter , immediately followed by a feeling of irritation . His  disturbance of mind continued ; he felt that he must go away somewhere ,  anywhere .  Above his head some little bird sang out , of a sudden ; he began to peer  about for it among the leaves . Suddenly the bird darted out of the tree  and away , and instantly he thought of the “ fly buzzing about in the  sun ’s rays ” that Hippolyte had talked of ; how that it knew its place  and was a participator in the universal life , while he alone was an  “ outcast . ” This picture had impressed him at the time , and he meditated  upon it now . An old , forgotten memory awoke in his brain , and suddenly  burst into clearness and light . It was a recollection of Switzerland ,  during the first year of his cure , the very first months . At that time  he had been pretty nearly an idiot still ; he could not speak properly ,  and had difficulty in understanding when others spoke to him . He  climbed the mountain - side , one sunny morning , and wandered long and  aimlessly with a certain thought in his brain , which would not become  clear . Above him was the blazing sky , below , the lake

Next time you have any money and jewels , turn  them to good account instead of hoarding them up . ”  9 . Do you think the Brahman was of any real use to the people of  Sravasti ?  10 . In what qualities do you think the Brahman was wanting when he made  up his mind to starve himself to death ?  CHAPTER VI  In spite of all that any one could say to him , the Brahman was quite  determined that he would not live any longer . He set off to the place  of pilgrimage he had chosen , taking no notice of any one he met , but  just marching steadily on . At first a number of people followed him ,  but by degrees they left off doing so , and soon he was quite alone .  Presently however he could not help noticing a man approaching from the  direction in which he was going . Very tall , very handsome , very  dignified , this man was one whom no one could fail to admire , even if  he had been only an ordinary person . But he was the king of the whole  country , whose name was Prasnajit ; and a little distance behind him  were a number of his attendants , waiting to obey his orders . Everybody ,  even the Brahman , loved the king , because he took such a very great  interest in his people and was always trying to do them good . He had  heard all about the loss of the money , and was very much vexed that  such a thing should have happened in his land . He had also heard that  the Brahman meant to kill himself , and this distressed him more than  anything else , because he thought it a very wicked and terrible thing  to do .  The king stood so exactly in the path of the Brahman that it was  impossible to pass him by without taking any notice of him , and the  unhappy man stood still , hanging down his head and looking very  miserable . Without waiting for a moment , Prasnajit said to the Brahman :  “

"	"I left the glass and sat  down by the window , looking out . I saw nothing in the street : I just  looked into a blackness . My mind was as blank as the night and as  soundless . There was a swirl outside the window , rain tossed by the  wind ; without noticing , I saw it , and my brain swung with the rain until  it heaved in circles , and then a feeling of faintness awakened me to  myself . I did not allow my mind to think , but now and again a word  swooped from immense distances through my brain , swinging like a comet  across a sky and jarring terribly when it struck : ‘ Sacked ’ was one word ,  ‘ Old ’ was another word .  “ I do n’t know how long I sat watching the flight of these dreadful words  and listening to their clanking impact , but a movement in the street  aroused me . Two people , the girl and a young , slender man , were coming  slowly up to the house . The rain was falling heavily , but they did not  seem to mind it . There was a big puddle of water close to the kerb , and  the girl , stepping daintily as a cat , went round this , but the young man  stood for a moment beyond it . He raised both arms , clenched his fists ,  swung them , and jumped over the puddle . Then he and the girl stood  looking at the water , apparently measuring the jump . I could see them  plainly by a street lamp . They were bidding each other good - bye . The  girl put her hand to his neck and settled the collar of his coat , and  while her hand rested on him the young man suddenly and violently flung  his arms about her and hugged her ; then they kissed and moved apart . The  man walked to the rain puddle and stood there with his face turned back  laughing at her , and then he jumped straight into the middle of the  puddle and began to dance up and down in it , the muddy water splashing  up to his knees . She ran over to him crying ‘ Stop , silly ! ’ When she came  into the house , I bolted my door and I gave no answer to her knock .  “ In a few months the money I had saved was spent . I could n’t get any  work , I was too old ; they put it that they wanted a younger man . I  could n’t pay my rent . I went out into the world again , like

But Sir Launcelot put by the blow with his sword so that it did him no  harm . But therewith he waxed so wroth that he ground his teeth together  with anger , and , rising in his stirrups , he lashed that churl so woeful a  blow that he cleft through his iron cap and his head and his breast even to  the paps .  [ Sidenote : The folk warn Sir Launcelot ] Now when the people of the town  beheld that terrible blow they lifted up their voices in a great outcry ,  crying out : "" Turn back , Sir Knight !

"" And others cried : "" Thou art a dead man  unless thou make haste away from this . "" But to all this Sir Launcelot paid  no heed , but wiped his sword and thrust it back into its sheath . Then he  went forward upon his way across the bridge as though nothing had befallen ,  and so came to the farther side . Then , without paying any heed to all the  people who were there , he rode straight to the castle and into the gate of  the castle and into the court - yard thereof .  Now by this time all the castle was astir , and in great tumult , and many  people came running to the windows and looked down upon Sir Launcelot . And  Sir Launcelot sat his horse and looked all about him . So he perceived that  beyond the court - yard was a fair space of grass , very smooth and green ,  well fitted for battle , wherefore he dismounted from his horse and tied it  to a ring in the wall , and then he went to that green field and made him  ready for whatever might befall .  Meantime all those people who were at the windows of the castle cried out  to him , as the people of the town had done : "" Go away , Sir Knight ! Go away  whilst there is still time for you to escape , or else you are a dead man ! ""  But Sir Launcelot replied not , but stood there and waited very steadfastly .  Then the great door of the castle hall opened , and there came forth  therefrom those two giants of whom he had heard tell .  [ Sidenote

The girl well knew this goblet contained a vile poison , one drop of  which on her tongue would cause death ; so she hesitated , trembling and  shrinking from the ordeal .  Prince Marvel looked into her sweet face with pitying eyes , and  stepping quickly to her side , took her hand in his .  "" Now drink !

"<fairy> At the first  ringing note of the music , they felt the vessel stir .
"	"Orpheus thrummed  away briskly , and the galley slid at once into the sea , dipping her prow  so deeply that the figure - head drank the wave with its marvelous lips ,  and rising again as buoyant as a swan . The rowers plied their fifty  oars ; the white foam boiled up before the prow ; the water gurgled and  bubbled in their wake ; while Orpheus continued to play so lively a  strain of music , that the vessel seemed to dance over the billows by way  of keeping time to it . Thus triumphantly did the Argo sail out of the  harbor , amidst the huzzas and good wishes of everybody except the wicked  old Pelias , who stood on a promontory , scowling at her , and wishing  that he could blow out of his lungs the tempest of wrath that was in his  heart , and so sink the galley with all on board . When they had sailed  above fifty miles over the sea , Lynceus happened to cast his sharp eyes  behind , and said that there was this bad - hearted king , still perched  upon the promontory , and scowling so gloomily that it looked like a  black thunder - cloud in that quarter of the horizon .  In order to make the time pass away more pleasantly during the voyage ,  the heroes talked about the Golden Fleece . It originally belonged , it  appears , to a Boeotian ram , who had taken on his back two children , when  in danger of their lives , and fled with them over land and sea as far  as Colchis . One of the children , whose name was Helle , fell into the sea  and was drowned . But the other ( a little boy , named Phrixus ) was brought  safe ashore by the faithful ram , who , however , was so exhausted that  he immediately lay down and died . In memory of this good deed , and as  a token of his true heart , the fleece of the poor dead ram was  miraculously changed to gold , and became one of the most beautiful  objects ever seen on earth . It was hung upon a tree in a sacred grove ,  where it had now been kept I know not how many years , and was the envy  of mighty kings , who had nothing so magnificent in any of their palaces .

"	"“ You do n’t hear  her , do you ? ” and they both listened .  “ The only sound I hear , ” said Wendy , “ is like a tinkle of bells . ”  “ Well , that ’s Tink , that ’s the fairy language . I think I hear her too . ”  The sound came from the chest of drawers , and Peter made a merry face .  No one could ever look quite so merry as Peter , and the loveliest of  gurgles was his laugh . He had his first laugh still .  “ Wendy , ” he whispered gleefully , “ I do believe I shut her up in the  drawer ! ”  He let poor Tink out of the drawer , and she flew about the nursery  screaming with fury . “ You should n’t say such things , ” Peter retorted .  “ Of course I ’m very sorry , but how could I know you were in the  drawer ? ”  Wendy was not listening to him . “ O Peter , ” she cried , “ if she would  only stand still and let me see her ! ”  “ They hardly ever stand still , ” he said , but for one moment Wendy saw  the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock . “ O the lovely ! ”  she cried , though Tink ’s face was still distorted with passion .  “ Tink , ” said Peter amiably , “ this lady says she wishes you were her  fairy . ”  Tinker Bell answered insolently .  “ What does she say , Peter ? ”  He had to translate . “ She is not very polite . She says you are a great  ugly girl , and that she is my fairy . ”  He tried to argue with Tink . “ You know you ca n’t be my fairy , Tink ,  because I am an gentleman and you are a lady . ”  To this Tink replied in these words , “ You silly ass , ” and disappeared  into the bathroom . “ She is quite a common fairy , ” Peter explained  apologetically , “ she is called Tinker Bell because she mends the pots  and kettles . ”  They were together in the armchair by this time , and Wendy plied him  with more questions .  “ If you do n’t live in Kensington Gardens now — ”  “ Sometimes I do still . ”  “ But where do you live mostly now ? ”  “ With the lost boys . ”  “ Who are they ? ”  “ They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the

As she spake , a great wave came up from the windward , and brake over us ,  and half filled the craft , and lifted her bows up towering , and then down  we went into the trough ; and I sat cowed and quaking , and spake never  another word .
"	" Now began the sun to sink , and the wind abated , and the sea went down ,  but the boat sped on as swift as ever over the landless waters .  Now the sun was down , and dusk was at hand , and the carline spake , and  drew a bright - gleaming sax from under her raiment : Damsels , I warn you  that now it were best that ye obey me in all things ; for though ye be  three and I one , yet whereas I have here an edge - friend , I may take the  life of any one of you , or of all three , as simply as I could cut a  lamb ’s throat .   Moreover it will serve you better in the house whereto ye  are wending , that I make a good tale of you rather than a bad .   For the  mistress of that house is of all might ; and I must say it of her , though  she is my very sister , yet she is not so sweet - tempered and kind of heart  as I am , but somewhat rough and unyielding of mood , so that it is best to  please her .   Wherefore , maidens , I rede you be sage .  Our unhappy hearts were now so sunken in wan - hope , that we had no word  wherewith to answer her , and she spake : Now obey ye my bidding and eat  and drink , that ye may come hale and sound to your journey ’s end , for I  would not give starvelings to my dear sister .   Therewith she brought  forth victual for us , and that nought evil , of flesh and bread , and  cheese and cakes , and good wine withal ; and we were hunger - weary as well  as sorrow - weary ; and hunger did at that moment overcome sorrow , so we ate  and drank , and , would we , would we not , something of heart came back to  us thereby .   Then again spake the carline : Now my will is that ye sleep ;  and ye have cushions and cloths enough to dight you a fair bed ; and this  bidding is easy for you to obey .   Forsooth , so weary were we with sorrow ,  and our hunger was now quenched , that we laid us down and slept at once ,  and forgat our troubles .  When we awoke it was after the first dawn , and we were come aland even  where thou didst this morning , guest .   And thou mayst deem it wondrous ,  but so it was , that close to where

"<fairy> THE CAUSE OF A LAWSUIT BETWEEN THE OWL AND THE KITE  The owl and the kite once went to law on these grounds .
"	"The owl said  that she was the oldest creature in the world , and that when the  world was first made , she alone existed . The kite objected . He said  that he flew in the air and lived in the trees .  To prove which was right they went to law , and the owl pleaded that ,  since there were no trees at the beginning of the world , the kite  was wrong in saying that he had lived in trees . The Judge therefore  decided in favour of the owl .  A MONKEY OBJECTS TO CRITICISM  A monkey once sat on a tree , shivering with cold , as rain was falling ,  and a little bird sat in its nest on the same tree ; and , as it sat ,  it looked at the monkey and wondered why a creature with hands and  feet like a man should shiver in the cold , while a small bird rested  in comfort .  At last it expressed its thought to the monkey , who replied : "" I have  not strength to build myself a house , but I have strength to destroy  yours , "" and with that he pulled to pieces the poor little bird 's nest ,  and turned it out with its young .  THE DEAD MAN 'S RING  A young married woman one night listened to the jackals ' cry , and heard  them say : "" Near the river lies a dead man ; go and look on his finger  and you will find a ring worth nine lakhs of rupees . "" She therefore  rose and went to the riverside , not knowing that her husband secretly  followed in her footsteps . Arrived there , she found the dead man , but  the ring was difficult to remove , so she drew it off with her teeth .  Her husband , who did not know she had understood and acted upon the  cry of the jackals , was horrified , and thought she was eating the flesh  of the dead man ; so he returned home , and when the morning came , took  his wife to her mother , and said : "" I have brought back your daughter ,  and refuse to live with her any longer , lest I come to some evil  end . "" He gave no reason for having thus said , and returned to his home .  In the evening his wife sat sorrowfully in the garden of her father 's  house , and the crows came to roost in the peepul trees ; and as they  came , they said : "" In this place are buried four boxes containing  hidden treasure : dig and find it

"	"I saw light — a regular flash of light .  “ Yesterday was — — ? ”  “ The anniversary of the wedding . I ’d arranged to take Mary to the  Savoy , and on to Covent Garden . She particularly wanted to hear Caruso .  I had the ticket for the box in my pocket . Do you know , all through  dinner I had a kind of rummy idea that there was something I ’d  forgotten , but I could n’t think what ? ”  “ Till your wife mentioned it ? ”  He nodded — —  “ She — mentioned it , ” he said thoughtfully .  I did n’t ask for details . Women with hair and chins like Mary ’s may be  angels most of the time , but , when they take off their wings for a bit ,  they are n’t half - hearted about it .  “ To be absolutely frank , old top , ” said poor old Bobbie , in a broken  sort of way , “ my stock ’s pretty low at home . ”  There did n’t seem much to be done . I just lit a cigarette and sat  there . He did n’t want to talk . Presently he went out . I stood at the  window of our upper smoking - room , which looks out on to Piccadilly , and  watched him . He walked slowly along for a few yards , stopped , then  walked on again , and finally turned into a jeweller ’s . Which was an  instance of what I meant when I said that deep down in him there was a  certain stratum of sense .  It was from now on that I began to be really interested in this problem  of Bobbie ’s married life . Of course , one ’s always mildly interested in  one ’s friends ’ marriages , hoping they ’ll turn out well and all that ;  but this was different . The average man is n’t like Bobbie , and the  average girl is n’t like Mary . It was that old business of the immovable  mass and the irresistible force . There was Bobbie , ambling gently  through life , a dear old chap in a hundred ways , but undoubtedly a  chump of the first water .  And there was Mary , determined that he should n’t be a chump . And  Nature , mind you , on Bobbie ’s side . When Nature makes a chump like dear  old Bobbie , she ’s proud of him , and does n’t want her handiwork  disturbed . She gives him a sort of natural armour to protect him  against outside interference . And that armour is shortness

"	"“ I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park , he  danced from eight o’clock till four , without once sitting down . ”  “ Did he indeed ? ” cried Marianne with sparkling eyes , “ and with  elegance , with spirit ? ”  “ Yes ; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert . ”  “ That is what I like ; that is what a young man ought to be . Whatever be  his pursuits , his eagerness in them should know no moderation , and  leave him no sense of fatigue . ”  “ Aye , aye , I see how it will be , ” said Sir John , “ I see how it will be .  You will be setting your cap at him now , and never think of poor  Brandon . ”  “ That is an expression , Sir John , ” said Marianne , warmly , “ which I  particularly dislike . I abhor every common - place phrase by which wit is  intended ; and ‘ setting one ’s cap at a man , ’ or ‘ making a conquest , ’ are  the most odious of all . Their tendency is gross and illiberal ; and if  their construction could ever be deemed clever , time has long ago  destroyed all its ingenuity . ”  Sir John did not much understand this reproof ; but he laughed as  heartily as if he did , and then replied ,  “ Ay , you will make conquests enough , I dare say , one way or other . Poor  Brandon ! he is quite smitten already , and he is very well worth setting  your cap at , I can tell you , in spite of all this tumbling about and  spraining of ankles . ”  CHAPTER X.  Marianne ’s preserver , as Margaret , with more elegance than precision ,  styled Willoughby , called at the cottage early the next morning to make  his personal enquiries . He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with more than  politeness ; with a kindness which Sir John ’s account of him and her own  gratitude prompted ; and every thing that passed during the visit tended  to assure him of the sense , elegance , mutual affection , and domestic  comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced him . Of their  personal charms he had not required a second interview to be convinced .  Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion , regular features , and a  remarkably pretty figure . Marianne was still handsomer . Her form ,  though not so correct as her sister ’s , in having the advantage of  height , was more striking ;

"<fantasy> So they took their bows  and obeyed , leaving the craftsmen at their work in the castle , which  was now quite roofed over , towers and all .
"	"They went through the forest  by little paths that they knew , going swiftly and warily in the  bowmen 's way : and just before nightfall they were at the forest 's edge ,  though they went no farther from it than its shadows go in the evening .  And there they rested under the oak trees for the early part of the  night except those whose art it was to gather news for their king ; and  three of those went into Lowlight and mixed with the villagers there .  When white mists moved over the fields near dawn and wavered ghostly  about Lowlight , the green bowman moved with them . And just out of  hearing of the village , behind wild shrubs that hid them , the bowmen  that were coming from the forest met the three that had spent the night  in taverns of Lowlight . And the three told the hundred of the great  wedding that there was to be in the Church of the Renunciation that  morning in Lowlight : and of the preparations that were made , and how  holy men had come from far on mules , and had slept the night in the  village , and the Bishop of Toledo himself would bless the bridegroom 's  sword . The bowmen therefore retired a little way and , moving through  the mists , came forward to points whence they could watch the church ,  well concealed on the wild plain , which here and there gave up a field  to man but was mostly the playground of wild creatures whose ways were  the bowmen 's ways . And here they waited .  This was the wedding of Rodriguez and Serafina , of which gossips often  spoke at their doors in summer evenings , old women mumbling of fair  weddings that each had seen ; and they had been children when they saw  this wedding ; they were those that threw small handfuls of anemones on  the path before the porch . They told the tale of it till they could  tell no more . It is the account of the last two or three of them , old ,  old women , that came at last to these chronicles , so that their tongues  may wag as it were a little longer through these pages although they  have been for so many centuries dead . And this is all that books are  able to do .  First there was bell - ringing and many voices , and then the voices  hushed , and there came the procession of eight divines of Murcia , whose  vestments were strange to Lowlight . Then there came a priest from the  South , near the border of Andalusia , who overnight had

"<fantasy> After several hours had been spent in this congenial occupation ,  Yat Huang proceeded to read aloud several of the sixteen discourses on  education which , taken together , form the discriminating and infallible  example of conduct known as the Holy Edict .
"	"As each detail was dwelt  upon Yin arose from his couch and gave his deliberate testimony that  all the required tests and rites had been observed in his own case .  The first part of the repast was then partaken of , the nature of the  ingredients and the manner of preparing them being fully explained ,  and in a like manner through each succeeding one of the four - and - forty  courses . At the conclusion Yin again arose , being encouraged by the  repeated uttering of his name by those present , and with extreme modesty  and brilliance set forth his manner of thinking concerning all subjects  with which he was acquainted .  Early on the morning of the following day Yin set out on his travels ,  entirely unaccompanied , and carrying with him nothing beyond a sum of  money , a silk robe , and a well - tried and reliable spear . For many days  he journeyed in a northerly direction , without encountering anything  sufficiently unusual to engage his attention . This , however , was  doubtless part of a pre - arranged scheme so that he should not be drawn  from a destined path , for at a small village lying on the southern shore  of a large lake , called by those around Silent Water , he heard of the  existence of a certain sacred island , distant a full day ’s sailing ,  which was barren of all forms of living things , and contained only a  single gigantic rock of divine origin and majestic appearance . Many  persons , the villagers asserted , had sailed to the island in the hope  of learning the portent of the rock , but none ever returned , and they  themselves avoided coming even within sight of it ; for the sacred stone ,  they declared , exercised an evil influence over their ships , and would ,  if permitted , draw them out of their course and towards itself . For this  reason Yin could find no guide , whatever reward he offered , who would  accompany him ; but having with difficulty succeeded in hiring a small  boat of inconsiderable value , he embarked with food , incense , and  materials for building fires , and after rowing consistently for nearly  the whole of the day , came within sight of the island at evening .  Thereafter the necessity of further exertion ceased , for , as they of the  village had declared would be the case , the vessel moved gently forward ,  in an unswerving line , without being in any way propelled , and reaching  its destination in a marvellously short space of time , passed behind a  protecting spur of land and

"<fantasy> Smiling they came , but all wistfully anxious , as though their  errand were paramount and their span short : he saw them cluster about  him , running now , bringing their tiny gifts , and scarcely heard the  heavy sigh of his guard as Rodriguez gagged him and Morano tied him up .
"	" Had Rodriguez now released the prisoner they could have been three to  three , in the event of things going wrong with the sleep of la Garda ;  but , since in the same time they could gag and bind another , the odds  would be the same at two to two , and Rodriguez preferred this to the  slight uncertainties that would be connected with the entry of another  partner . They accordingly gagged the next man and bound his wrists and  ankles . And that Spanish wine held good with the other two and bound  them far down among the deeps of dreams : and so it should , for it was  of a vine that grew in the vales of Spain and had ripened in one of the  years of the golden age .  They bound one as easily as they had bound the other two ; and the last  Rodriguez watched while Morano cut the ropes off the prisoner , for he  had run out of bits of twine and all other improvisations . With these  ropes he ran back to his master , and they tied up the last prisoner but  did not gag him .  "" Shall we gag him , master , like the rest ? "" said Morano .  "" No , "" said Rodriguez . "" He has nothing to say . ""  And though this remark turned out to be strictly untrue , it well enough  answered its purpose .  And then they saw standing before them the man they had freed . And he  bowed to Rodriguez like one that had never bowed before . I do not mean  that he bowed with awkwardness , like imitative men unused to  politeness , but he bowed as the oak bows to the woodman ; he stood  straight , looking Rodriguez in the eyes , then he bowed as though he had  let his spirit break , which allowed him to bow to never a man before .  Thus , if my pen has been able dimly to tell of it , thus bowed the man  in the old leathern jacket . And Rodriguez bowed to him in answer with  the elegance that they that had dwelt at Arguento Harez had slowly  drawn from the ages .  "" Señor , your name , "" said the stranger .  "" Lord of Arguento Harez , "" said Rodriguez .  "" Señor , "" he said , "" being a busy man , I have seldom time to pray . And  the blessed Saints , being more busy than I , I think seldom hear my  prayers : yet your name shall go up to them . I will often tell it them  quietly in the forest ,

"<fantasy> Rodriguez then looked round for some hidden door ,  the sword all the while in his hand , and very soon he knew that room  fairly well , but not its secret , nor why those unknown gallants had  given up their rings .
"	" It is much to know of an unknown danger that it really is unknown . Many  have met their deaths through looking for danger from one particular  direction , whereas had they perceived that they were ignorant of its  direction they would have been wise in their ignorance . Rodriguez had  the great discretion to understand clearly that he did not know the  direction from which danger would come . He accepted this as his only  discovery about that portentous room which seemed to beckon to him with  every shadow and to sigh over him with every mournful draught , and to  whisper to him unintelligible warnings with every rustle of tattered  silk that hung about his bed . And as soon as he discovered that this  was his only knowledge he began at once to make his preparations : he  was a right young man for the wars . He divested himself of his shoes  and doublet and the light cloak that hung from his shoulder and cast  the clothes on a chair . Over the back of the chair he slung his girdle  and the scabbard hanging therefrom and placed his plumed hat so that  none could see that his Castilian blade was not in its resting - place .  And when the sombre chamber had the appearance of one having undressed  in it before retiring Rodriguez turned his attention to the bed , which  he noticed to be of great depth and softness . That something not unlike  blood had been spilt on the floor excited no wonder in Rodriguez ; that  vast chamber was evidently , as I have said , in the fortress of some  great family , against one of whose walls the humble inn had once leaned  for protection ; the great family were gone : how they were gone  Rodriguez did not know , but it excited no wonder in him to see blood on  the boards : besides , two gallants may have disagreed ; or one who loved  not dumb animals might have been killing rats . Blood did not disturb  him ; but what amazed him , and would have surprised anyone who stood in  that ruinous room , was that there were clean new sheets on the bed . Had  you seen the state of the furniture and the floor , O my reader , and the  vastness of the old cobwebs and the black dust that they held , the dead  spiders and huge dead flies , and the living generation of spiders  descending and ascending through the gloom , I say that you also would  have been surprised at the sight of those nice clean sheets . Rodriguez  noted the fact and continued his preparations . He took the bolster from

""  It was the very next day that the Sheriff went into the room where  young Robin 's aunt was seated , looking very unhappy , and she jumped  up from her chair wonderingly on seeing that her brother - in - law was  dressed as if for a journey , wearing no sword or dagger , only  carrying a long stout walking staff .  "" Where are you going , dear ? "" she said .  "" Where I ought to have gone at first , "" he said humbly ; "" into the  forest to fetch my boy .

It was the outlaws ' supper time , the sun being their clock in the  forest ; and the men were gathering together to enjoy their second  great meal of the day , the other being breakfast , after having  which they always separated to go hunting through the woods to  bring in the provisions for the next day .  Robin Hood 's men , then , were scattered about under the shade of a  huge spreading oak tree , waiting for the roast venison , which sent  a very pleasant odor from the glowing fire of oak wood , and young  Robin was seated on the mossy grass close by the thatched shed  which formed the captain 's headquarters , where Maid Marian was busy  spreading the supper for the little party who ate with Robin Hood  himself .  Little John was there , lying down , smiling and contented after a  hard day 's hunting , listening to young Robin , who was displaying  the treasures he had brought in that day , and telling his great  companion

"	"""  Hélène had stoutened . Monsieur de Soyecourt noted also that Hélène 's gold  hair was silvering now , as though Time had tangled cobwebs through it , and  that Gaston was profoundly unconscious of the fact . In Gaston 's eyes she  was at the most seventeen . Well , Hélène had always been admirable in her  management of all , and it would be diverting to see that youngest child of  hers .... Meanwhile it was diverting also to observe how conscientiously she  was exerting a good influence over Gaston : and de Soyecourt smiled to find  that she shook her head at Gaston 's third glass , and that de Puysange did  not venture on a fourth . Victoria , to do her justice , had never meddled  with any of her husband 's vices ....  As for the Duchess of Ormskirk , Louis de Soyecourt had known from the  beginning -- in comparative youthfulness,--that Claire would placidly order  her portion of the world as she considered expedient , and that Ormskirk  would travesty her , and somewhat bewilder her , and that in the ultimate  Ormskirk would obey her to the letter .  Captain Audaine Monsieur de Soyecourt considered at the start diverting ,  and in the end a pompous bore . Yet they assured him that Audaine was  getting on prodigiously in the House of Commons , [ Footnote : The Captain 's  personal quarrel with the Chevalier St. George and its remarkable upshot ,  at Antwerp , as well as the Captain 's subsequent renunciation of Jacobitism ,  are best treated of in Garendon 's own memoirs.]--as , _ ma foi _ ! he would  most naturally do , since his _ métier _ was simply to shout well - rounded  common - places,--and the circumstance that he shouted would always attract  attention , while the fact that he shouted platitudes would invariably  prevent his giving offence . Lord Humphrey Degge was found a ruddy and  comely person , of no especial importance , but de Soyecourt avidly took note  of Mr. Erwyn 's waistcoat . Why , this man was a genius ! Monsieur de Soyecourt  at first glance decided . Staid , demure even , yet with a quiet prodigality  of color and ornament , an inevitableness of cut -- Oh , beyond doubt , this man  was a genius !  As for the ladies at Ingilby , they were adjudged to be handsome women ,  one and all , but quite unattractive , since they evinced not any excessive  interest in Monsieur de Soyecourt . Here was no sniff of future conquest ,  not one side - long glance , but merely three wives unblushingly addicted to  their own husbands . _ Eh bien _ !

"	"He , too , is pointed out .  “ Apparently the English advocate is in a swoon ? ”  It is hoped he will recover in the fresher air . It is represented that  he is not in strong health , and has separated sadly from a friend who is  under the displeasure of the Republic .  “ Is that all ? It is not a great deal , that ! Many are under the  displeasure of the Republic , and must look out at the little window .  Jarvis Lorry . Banker . English . Which is he ? ”  “ I am he .

It  is Jarvis Lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach  door , replying to a group of officials . They leisurely walk round the  carriage and leisurely mount the box , to look at what little luggage it  carries on the roof ; the country - people hanging about , press nearer to  the coach doors and greedily stare in ; a little child , carried by its  mother , has its short arm held out for it , that it may touch the wife of  an aristocrat who has gone to the Guillotine .  “ Behold your papers , Jarvis Lorry , countersigned . ”  “ One can depart , citizen ? ”  “ One can depart .

"	"Save that it cast no shadow , the ' rickshaw  was in every respect as real to look upon as one of wood and iron . More  than once , indeed , I have had to check myself from warning some  hard - riding friend against cantering over it . More than once I have walked  down the Mall deep in conversation with Mrs. Wessington to the unspeakable  amazement of the passers - by .  Before I had been out and about a week I learned that the "" fit "" theory had  been discarded in favor of insanity . However , I made no change in my mode  of life . I called , rode , and dined out as freely as ever . I had a passion  for the society of my kind which I had never felt before ; I hungered to be  among the realities of life ; and at the same time I felt vaguely unhappy  when I had been separated too long from my ghostly companion . It would be  almost impossible to describe my varying moods from the 15th of May up to  to - day .  The presence of the ' rickshaw filled me by turns with horror , blind fear ,  a dim sort of pleasure , and utter despair . I dared not leave Simla ; and I  knew that my stay there was killing me . I knew , moreover , that it was my  destiny to die slowly and a little every day . My only anxiety was to get  the penance over as quietly as might be . Alternately I hungered for a  sight of Kitty and watched her outrageous flirtations with my  successor -- to speak more accurately , my successors -- with amused interest .  She was as much out of my life as I was out of hers . By day I wandered  with Mrs. Wessington almost content . By night I implored Heaven to let me  return to the world as I used to know it . Above all these varying moods  lay the sensation of dull , numbing wonder that the Seen and the Unseen  should mingle so strangely on this earth to hound one poor soul to its  grave .         *         *         *         *         *  _ August 27._--Heatherlegh has been indefatigable in his attendance on me ;  and only yesterday told me that I ought to send in an application for sick  leave .

"	" CHAPTER X.  DICKON  The sun shone down for nearly a week on the secret garden . The Secret  Garden was what Mary called it when she was thinking of it . She liked  the name , and she liked still more the feeling that when its beautiful  old walls shut her in no one knew where she was . It seemed almost like  being shut out of the world in some fairy place . The few books she had  read and liked had been fairy - story books , and she had read of secret  gardens in some of the stories . Sometimes people went to sleep in them  for a hundred years , which she had thought must be rather stupid . She  had no intention of going to sleep , and , in fact , she was becoming  wider awake every day which passed at Misselthwaite . She was beginning  to like to be out of doors ; she no longer hated the wind , but enjoyed  it . She could run faster , and longer , and she could skip up to a  hundred . The bulbs in the secret garden must have been much astonished .  Such nice clear places were made round them that they had all the  breathing space they wanted , and really , if Mistress Mary had known it ,  they began to cheer up under the dark earth and work tremendously . The  sun could get at them and warm them , and when the rain came down it  could reach them at once , so they began to feel very much alive .  Mary was an odd , determined little person , and now she had something  interesting to be determined about , she was very much absorbed , indeed .  She worked and dug and pulled up weeds steadily , only becoming more  pleased with her work every hour instead of tiring of it . It seemed to  her like a fascinating sort of play . She found many more of the  sprouting pale green points than she had ever hoped to find . They  seemed to be starting up everywhere and each day she was sure she found  tiny new ones , some so tiny that they barely peeped above the earth .  There were so many that she remembered what Martha had said about the  “ snowdrops by the thousands , ” and about bulbs spreading and making new  ones . These had been left to themselves for ten years and perhaps they  had spread , like the snowdrops , into thousands . She wondered how long  it would be before they showed that they were flowers . Sometimes she  stopped digging to look at the garden and try to imagine what it

"<fairy>  “ Because I love the gardener ’s son , ” answered the Princess .
"	" On hearing this the King was at first very angry , and then he wept and  sighed , and declared that such a husband was not worthy of his daughter ;  but the young Princess was not to be turned from her resolution to marry  the gardener ’s son .  Then the King consulted his ministers . “ This is what you must do , ” they  said . “ To get rid of the gardener you must send both suitors to a  very distant country , and the one who returns first shall marry your  daughter . ”  The King followed this advice , and the minister ’s son was presented with  a splendid horse and a purse full of gold pieces , while the gardener ’s  son had only an old lame horse and a purse full of copper money , and  every one thought he would never come back from his journey .  The day before they started the Princess met her lover and said to him :  “ Be brave , and remember always that I love you . Take this purse full of  jewels and make the best use you can of them for love of me , and come  back quickly and demand my hand . ”  The two suitors left the town together , but the minister ’s son went off  at a gallop on his good horse , and very soon was lost to sight behind  the most distant hills . He traveled on for some days , and presently  reached a fountain beside which an old woman all in rags sat upon a  stone .  “ Good - day to you , young traveler , ” said she .  But the minister ’s son made no reply .  “ Have pity upon me , traveler , ” she said again . “ I am dying of hunger ,  as you see , and three days have I been here and no one has given me  anything . ”  “ Let me alone , old witch , ” cried the young man ; “ I can do nothing for  you , ” and so saying he went on his way .  That same evening the gardener ’s son rode up to the fountain upon his  lame gray horse .  “ Good - day to you , young traveler , ” said the beggar - woman .  “ Good - day , good woman , ” answered he .  “ Young traveler , have pity upon me . ”  “ Take my purse , good woman , ” said he , “ and mount behind me , for your  legs ca n’t be very strong . ”  The old woman did n’t wait to be asked twice

"	"At last , having  hit upon an enterprise that promised to turn out as fatally as he  desired , he sent for the youthful Perseus .  The young man came to the palace , and found the king sitting upon his  throne .  "" Perseus , "" said King Polydectes , smiling craftily upon him , "" you are  grown up a fine young man . You and your good mother have received a  great deal of kindness from myself , as well as from my worthy brother  the fisherman , and I suppose you would not be sorry to repay some of  it . ""  "" Please your Majesty , "" answered Perseus , "" I would willingly risk my  life to do so . ""  "" Well , then , "" continued the king , still with a cunning smile on his  lips , "" I have a little adventure to propose to you ; and , as you are a  brave and enterprising youth , you will doubtless look upon it as a  great piece of good luck to have so rare an opportunity of  distinguishing yourself . You must know , my good Perseus , I think of  getting married to the beautiful Princess Hippodamia ; and it is  customary , on these occasions , to make the bride a present of some  far - fetched and elegant curiosity . I have been a little perplexed , I  must honestly confess , where to obtain anything likely to please a  princess of her exquisite taste . But , this morning , I flatter myself ,  I have thought of precisely the article . ""  "" And can I assist your Majesty in obtaining it ? "" cried Perseus ,  eagerly .  "" You can , if you are as brave a youth as I believe you to be , "" replied  King Polydectes , with the utmost graciousness of manner . "" The bridal  gift which I have set my heart on presenting to the beautiful  Hippodamia is the head of the Gorgon Medusa with the snaky locks ; and  I depend on you , my dear Perseus , to bring it to me . So , as I am  anxious to settle affairs with the princess , the sooner you go in  quest of the Gorgon , the better I shall be pleased . ""  "" I will set out to - morrow morning , "" answered Perseus .  "" Pray do so , my gallant youth , "" rejoined the king .

Why , I was but  a child , my lord , when you came . Have you forgotten , then , the lank ,  awkward child who used to stare at you so gravely ? ""  "" Mademoiselle , "" he returned , and now his voice trembled and still the  hunger in his eyes grew more great , "" I think that in all these years I  have forgotten nothing -- not even the most trivial happening ,  mademoiselle,--wherein you had a part . You were a very beautiful child .  Look you , I remember as if it were yesterday that you never wept when  your good lady mother -- whose soul may Christ have in his keeping!--was  forced to punish you for some little misdeed . No , you never wept ; but  your eyes would grow wistful , and you would come to me here in the  garden , and sit with me for a long time in silence . ' Fulke , ' you would  say , quite suddenly , ' I love you better than my mother . ' And I told you  that it was wrong to make such observations , did I not , mademoiselle ? My  faith , yes ! but I may confess now that I liked it , "" Fulke d'Arnaye ended ,  with a faint chuckle .  Adelais sat motionless . Certainly it was strange , she thought , how the  sound of this man 's voice had power to move her . Certainly , too , this man  was very foolish .  "" And now the child is a woman,--a woman who will presently be Marchioness  of Falmouth . Look you , when I get free of my prison -- and I shall get  free , never fear , mademoiselle,--I shall often think of that great lady .  For only God can curb a man 's dreams , and God is compassionate . So I hope  to dream nightly of a gracious lady whose hair is gold and whose eyes are  colored like the summer sea and whose voice is clear and low and very  wonderfully sweet . Nightly , I think , the vision of that dear enemy will  hearten me to fight for France by day . In effect , mademoiselle , your  traitor beauty will yet aid me to destroy your country .

"<fantasy> ""  There was no doubt poor An believed what she said , for her attitude was  one of extreme dejection while she spoke , and to cheer her I laughed .

You yourself do not look so far gone but what  some deed of abnegation , some strong love if you could but conceive it  would set you right again .   Surely you of the primrose robes can  sometimes love ? ""  Whereat unwittingly I troubled the waters in the placid soul of that  outcast Martian !   I can not exactly describe how it was , but she bent  her head silently for a moment or two , and then , with a sigh , lifting  her eyes suddenly to mine , said quietly , "" Yes , sometimes ;  sometimes -- but very seldom , "" while for an instant across her face there  flashed the summer lightning of a new hope , a single transient glance  of wistful , timid entreaty ; of wonder and delight that dared not even  yet acknowledge itself .  Then it was my turn to sit silent , and the pause was so awkward that in  a minute , to break it , I exclaimed--  "" Let 's drop personalities , old chap -- I mean my dear Miss An .   Tell me  something about your people , and let us begin properly at the top : have  you got a king , for instance ? ""  To this the girl , pulling herself out of the pleasant slough of her  listlessness , and falling into my vein , answered--  "" Both yes and no , sir traveller from afar -- no chiefly , and yet perhaps  yes .   If it were no then it were so , and if yes then Hath were our  king . ""  "" A mild king I should judge by your uncertainty .   In the place where I  came from kings press their individualities somewhat more clearly on  their subjects ' minds .   Is Hath here in the city ?   Does he come to your  feasts today ?

"	" The man - at - arms brought also a letter from Queen Dolores , and this  Jurgen read with a frown .  "" Do you consider now what fun it would be to hood - wink everybody by  pretending to conform to our laws ! "" said this letter , and it said  nothing more : Dolores was really a wise woman . Yet there was a  postscript . "" For we could be so happy ! "" said the postscript .  And Jurgen looked toward the Woods , where men were sawing up a great  oak - tree . And Jurgen gave a fine laugh , and with fine deliberateness  he tore up the Queen 's letter into little strips . Then statelily he  took the parchments , and found they were so tough he could not tear  them . This was uncommonly awkward , for Jurgen 's ill - advised attempt  to tear the parchments impaired the dignity of his magnanimous  self - sacrifice : he even suspected one of the guards of smiling . So  there was nothing for it but presently to give up that futile tugging  and jerking , and to compromise by crumpling these parchments .  "" This is my answer , "" said Jurgen heroically , and with some  admiration of himself , but still a little dashed by the uncalled - for  toughness of the parchments .  Then Jurgen cried farewell to fallen Leukê ; and scornfully he cried  farewell to the Philistines and to their devices . Then he submitted  to their devices .

But Joe ’s spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection . He was so  homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it . The tears lay  very near the surface . Huck was melancholy , too .

"	"There sat the poor little  fellow , with his sister on his lap , and he sang to her all the songs he  knew ; and he glanced the while from time to time into the geography - book  that lay open before him . By the next morning he was to have learnt  all the towns in Zealand by heart , and to know about them all that is  possible to be known .  His mother now came home , for she had been out , and took little Augusta  on her arm . Tuk ran quickly to the window , and read so eagerly that he  pretty nearly read his eyes out ; for it got darker and darker , but his  mother had no money to buy a candle .  “ There goes the old washerwoman over the way , ” said his mother , as she  looked out of the window . “ The poor woman can hardly drag herself along ,  and she must now drag the pail home from the fountain . Be a good boy ,  Tukey , and run across and help the old woman , wo n't you ? ”  So Tuk ran over quickly and helped her ; but when he came back again into  the room it was quite dark , and as to a light , there was no thought of  such a thing . He was now to go to bed ; that was an old turn - up bedstead ;  in it he lay and thought about his geography lesson , and of Zealand , and  of all that his master had told him . He ought , to be sure , to have read  over his lesson again , but that , you know , he could not do . He therefore  put his geography - book under his pillow , because he had heard that was  a very good thing to do when one wants to learn one 's lesson ; but one  can not , however , rely upon it entirely . Well , there he lay , and thought  and thought , and all at once it was just as if someone kissed his eyes  and mouth : he slept , and yet he did not sleep ; it was as though the old  washerwoman gazed on him with her mild eyes and said , “ It were a great  sin if you were not to know your lesson tomorrow morning . You have aided  me , I therefore will now help you ; and the loving God will do so at all  times . ” And all of a sudden the book under Tuk 's pillow began scraping  and scratching .  “ Kickery - ki ! kluk ! kluk ! kluk!”--that

He used to have a ride before  dinner , and his suite on those occasions were generally Davoust ,  myself , and Roustan . ”  “ Constant ? ” said the prince , suddenly , and quite involuntarily .  “ No ; Constant was away then , taking a letter to the Empress Josephine .  Instead of him there were always a couple of orderlies — and that was  all , excepting , of course , the generals and marshals whom Napoleon  always took with him for the inspection of various localities , and for  the sake of consultation generally . I remember there was  one — Davoust — nearly always with him — a big man with spectacles . They used  to argue and quarrel sometimes . Once they were in the Emperor ’s study  together — just those two and myself — I was unobserved — and they argued ,  and the Emperor seemed to be agreeing to something under protest .  Suddenly his eye fell on me and an idea seemed to flash across him .  “ ‘ Child , ’ he said , abruptly . ‘ If I were to recognize the Russian  orthodox religion and emancipate the serfs , do you think Russia would  come over to me ? ’ ”  “ ‘ Never ! ’ I cried , indignantly . ”  “ The Emperor was much struck . ”  “ ‘ In the flashing eyes of this patriotic child I read and accept the  fiat of the Russian people . Enough , Davoust , it is mere phantasy on our  part . Come , let ’s hear your other project . ’ ”  “ Yes , but that was a great idea , ” said the prince , clearly interested .  “ You ascribe it to Davoust , do you ? ”  “ Well , at all events , they were consulting together at the time . Of  course it was the idea of an eagle , and must have originated with  Napoleon ; but the other project was good too — it was the ‘ Conseil du  lion ! ’ as Napoleon called it . This project consisted in a proposal to  occupy the Kremlin with the whole army ; to arm and fortify it  scientifically , to kill as many horses as could be got , and salt their  flesh , and spend the winter there ; and in spring to fight their way  out . Napoleon liked the idea — it attracted him . We rode round the  Kremlin walls every day , and Napoleon used to give orders where they  were to be patched , where built up , where pulled down and so on . All  was decided at

Then Geraint went and sounded the horn .   And at the first blast  he gave , the mist vanished .   And all the hosts came together , and they  all became reconciled to each other .   And the Earl invited Geraint and  the Little King to stay with him that night .   And the next morning they  separated .

"	"""  They had a hard voyage of it and much of baffling gales from the  south , and drove north into the main ; but they made Iceland , and were  by then come to the north off Longness when they found where they  were : so little space there was betwixt them that they spake together ;  and Asmund said that they had best sail to Islefirth , and thereto they  both agreed ; then they beat up toward the land , and a south - east wind  sprang up ; but when Onund and his folk laid the ship close to the  wind , the yard was sprung ; then they took in sail , and therewith were  driven off to sea ; but Asmund got under the lee of Brakeisle , and  there lay till a fair wind brought him into Islefirth ; Helgi the Lean  gave him all Kraeklings ' lithe , and he dwelt at South Glass - river ;  Asgrim his brother came out some winters later and abode at North  Glass - river ; he was the father of Ellida - Grim , the father of Asgrim  Ellida - Grimson .  CHAP . IX .  Now it is to be told of Onund Treefoot that he drave out to sea for  certain days , but at last the wind got round to the north , and they  sailed for land : then those knew who had been there before that they  had come west off the Skagi ; then they sailed into Strand - Bay , and  near to the South - Strands , and there rowed toward them six men in  a ten - oared boat , who hailed the big ship , and asked who was their  captain ; Onund named himself , and asked whence they came ; they said  they were house - carles of Thorvald , from Drangar ; Onund asked if all  land through the Strands had been settled ; they said there was little  unsettled in the inner Strands , and none north thereof . Then Onund  asked his shipmates , whether they would make for the west country , or  take such as they had been told of ; they chose to view the land first .  So they sailed in up the bay , and brought to in a creek off Arness ,  then put forth a boat and rowed to land . There dwelt a rich man ,  Eric Snare , who had taken land betwixt Ingolfs - firth , and Ufoera in  Fishless ; but when Eric knew that Onund was come there , he bade him  take of his hands whatso he would , but said that there was little that  had not been settled before .

"<fantasy>  He felt neither the streaming blood nor the throbbing agony of his  wounds ; every faculty of soul , mind , body , every power of life , was  centered in one intense , burning effort .
"	"He neither felt , thought , nor  reasoned , but clutching , with the blindness of instinct , the heavy ,  spiked , iron - headed mace that hung at the Earl 's saddle - bow , he gave it  one tremendous wrench that snapped the plaited leathern thongs that held  it as though they were skeins of thread . Then , grinding his teeth as  with a spasm , he struck as he had never struck before -- once , twice ,  thrice full upon the front of the helmet . Crash ! crash ! And then , even  as the Earl toppled sidelong , crash ! And the iron plates split and  crackled under the third blow . Myles had one flashing glimpse of an  awful face , and then the saddle was empty .  Then , as he held tight to the horse , panting , dizzy , sick to death , he  felt the hot blood gushing from his side , filling his body armor , and  staining the ground upon which he stood . Still he held tightly to the  saddle - bow of the fallen man 's horse until , through his glimmering  sight , he saw the Marshal , the Lieutenant , and the attendants gather  around him . He heard the Marshal ask him , in a voice that sounded faint  and distant , if he was dangerously wounded . He did not answer , and one  of the attendants , leaping from his horse , opened the umbril of his  helmet , disclosing the dull , hollow eyes , the ashy , colorless lips , and  the waxy forehead , upon which stood great beads of sweat .  “ Water ! water ! ” he cried , hoarsely ; “ give me to drink ! ” Then , quitting  his hold upon the horse , he started blindly across the lists towards the  gate of the barrier . A shadow that chilled his heart seemed to fall upon  him . “ It is death , ” he muttered ; then he stopped , then swayed for an  instant , and then toppled headlong , crashing as he fell .  CONCLUSION  But Myles was not dead . Those who had seen his face when the umbril of  the helmet was raised , and then saw him fall as he tottered across the  lists , had at first thought so . But his faintness was more from loss  of blood and the sudden unstringing of nerve and sense from the intense  furious strain of the last few moments of battle than from the vital  nature of the wound . Indeed , after Myles had been carried out of the  lists and laid upon the ground in the shade between the barriers

"<fantasy> And if they  can not understand those snatches of song , all about mortal things and  human needs , that are wafted rarely to them by chance passions , how  much more surely a young mortal heart , so near Rodriguez , heard what he  would say and understood the message however strange .
"	" When Dona Mirana and her daughter rose , exchanging their little  curtsies for the low bows of Rodriguez , and so retired for the night ,  the long room seemed to Rodriguez now empty of threatening omens . The  great portraits that the moon had lit , and that had frowned at him in  the moonlight when he came here before , frowned at him now no longer .  The anger that he had known to lurk in the darkness on pictured faces  of dead generations had gone with the gloom that it haunted : they were  all passionless now in the quiet light of the candles . He looked again  at the portraits eye to eye , remembering looks they had given him in  the moonlight , and all looked back at him with ages of apathy ; and he  knew that whatever glimmer of former selves there lurks about portraits  of the dead and gone was thinking only of their own past days in years  remote from Rodriguez . Whether their anger had flashed for a moment  over the ages on that night a month from now , or whether it was only  the moonlight , he never knew . Their spirits were back now surely  amongst their own days , whence they deigned not to look on the days  that make these chronicles .  Not till then did Rodriguez admit , or even know , that he had not eaten  since his noonday meal . But now he admitted this to Don Alderon 's  questions ; and Don Alderon led him to another chamber and there regaled  him with all the hospitality for which that time was famous . And when  Rodriguez had eaten , Don Alderon sent for wine , and the butler brought  it in an olden flagon , dark wine of a precious vintage : and soon the  two young men were drinking together and talking of the wickedness of  the Moors . And while they talked the night grew late and chilly and  still , and the hour came when moths are fewer and young men think of  bed . Then Don Alderon showed his guest to an upper room , a long room  dim with red hangings , and carvings in walnut and oak , which the one  candle he carried barely lit but only set queer shadows scampering . And  here he left Rodriguez , who was soon in bed , with the great red  hangings round him . And awhile he wondered at the huge silence of the  house all round him , with never a murmur , never an echo , never a sigh ;  for he missed the passing of winds , branches waving , the stirring of  small beasts , birds of prey

"<fairy>  He was ashamed to beg , because his father had always preached to him  that begging should be done only by the sick or the old .
"	"He had said  that the real poor in this world , deserving of our pity and help , were  only those who , either through age or sickness , had lost the means of  earning their bread with their own hands . All others should work , and if  they did n’t , and went hungry , so much the worse for them .  Just then a man passed by , worn out and wet with perspiration , pulling ,  with difficulty , two heavy carts filled with coal .  Pinocchio looked at him and , judging him by his looks to be a kind man ,  said to him with eyes downcast in shame :  “ Will you be so good as to give me a penny , for I am faint with hunger ? ”  “ Not only one penny , ” answered the Coal Man . “ I ’ll give you four if you  will help me pull these two wagons . ”  “ I am surprised ! ” answered the Marionette , very much offended . “ I wish  you to know that I never have been a donkey , nor have I ever pulled a  wagon . ”  “ So much the better for you ! ” answered the Coal Man . “ Then , my boy , if  you are really faint with hunger , eat two slices of your pride ; and I  hope they do n’t give you indigestion . ”  A few minutes after , a Bricklayer passed by , carrying a pail full of  plaster on his shoulder .  “ Good man , will you be kind enough to give a penny to a poor boy who is  yawning from hunger ? ”  “ Gladly , ” answered the Bricklayer . “ Come with me and carry some plaster ,  and instead of one penny , I ’ll give you five . ”  “ But the plaster is heavy , ” answered Pinocchio , “ and the work too hard  for me . ”  “ If the work is too hard for you , my boy , enjoy your yawns and may they  bring you luck ! ”  In less than a half hour , at least twenty people passed and Pinocchio  begged of each one , but they all answered :  “ Are n’t you ashamed ? Instead of being a beggar in the streets , why do n’t  you look for work and earn your own bread ? ”  Finally a little woman went by carrying two water jugs .  “ Good woman , will you allow me to have a drink from one of your jugs ? ”   asked Pinocchio , who was burning up with thirst .  “ With pleasure ,

"	"The Captain  now resolved to go himself , but , wiser than the others , he did not  mark the house , but looked at it so closely that he could not fail to  remember it . He returned , and ordered his men to go into the neighboring  villages and buy nineteen mules , and thirty - eight leather jars , all  empty except one , which was full of oil . The Captain put one of his men ,  fully armed , into each , rubbing the outside of the jars with oil from  the full vessel . Then the nineteen mules were loaded with thirty - seven  robbers in jars , and the jar of oil , and reached the town by dusk . The  Captain stopped his mules in front of Ali Baba ’s house , and said to Ali  Baba , who was sitting outside for coolness : “ I have brought some oil  from a distance to sell at to - morrow ’s market , but it is now so late  that I know not where to pass the night , unless you will do me the favor  to take me in . ” Though Ali Baba had seen the Captain of the robbers in  the forest , he did not recognize him in the disguise of an oil merchant .  He bade him welcome , opened his gates for the mules to enter , and  went to Morgiana to bid her prepare a bed and supper for his guest . He  brought the stranger into his hall , and after they had supped went again  to speak to Morgiana in the kitchen , while the Captain went into the  yard under pretense of seeing after his mules , but really to tell his  men what to do . Beginning at the first jar and ending at the last , he  said to each man : “ As soon as I throw some stones from the window of the  chamber where I lie , cut the jars open with your knives and come out ,  and I will be with you in a trice . ” He returned to the house ,  and Morgiana led him to his chamber . She then told Abdallah , her  fellow - slave , to set on the pot to make some broth for her master , who  had gone to bed . Meanwhile her lamp went out , and she had no more oil in  the house . “ Do not be uneasy , ” said Abdallah ; “ go into the yard and take  some out of one of those jars . ” Morgiana thanked him for his advice ,  took the oil pot , and went into the yard . When she came to the first

"	"So when they came to the isle , Grettir deemed it good  to behold , because it was grass - grown , and rose up sheer from the sea ,  so that no man might come up thereon save there where the ladders were  let down , and if the uppermost ladder were drawn up , it was no man 's  deed to get upon the island . There also were the cliffs full of fowl  in the summer - tide , and there were eighty sheep upon the island which  the bonders owned , and they were mostly rams and ewes which they had  mind to slaughter .  There Grettir set himself down in peace ; and by then had he been  fifteen or sixteen winters in outlawry , as Sturla Thordson has said .  CHAP . LXX .  < i > Of the Bonders who owned Drangey between them</i > .  In the days when Grettir came to Drangey , these were chief men of the  country side of Skagafirth . Hialti dwelt at Hof in Hialtidale , he  was the son of Thord , the son of Hialti , the son of Thord the Scalp :  Hialti was a great chief , a right noble man , and much befriended .  Thorbiorn Angle was the name of his brother , a big man and a strong ,  hardy and wild withal . Thord , the father of these twain , had married  again in his old age , and that wife was not the mother of the  brothers ; and she did ill to her step - children , but served Thorbiorn  the worst , for that he was hard to deal with and reckless . And on a  day Thorbiorn Angle sat playing at tables , and his stepmother passed  by and saw that he was playing at the knave - game , and the fashion of  the game was the large tail - game . Now she deemed him thriftless , and  cast some word at him , but he gave an evil answer ; so she caught up  one of the men , and drave the tail thereof into Thorbiorn 's cheek - bone  wherefrom it glanced into his eye , so that it hung out on his cheek .  He sprang up , caught hold of her , and handled her roughly , insomuch  that she took to her bed , and died thereof afterwards , and folk say  that she was then big with child .  Thereafter Thorbiorn became of all men the most riotous ; he took his  heritage , and dwelt at first in Woodwick .

"	"  She nodded yeasay , and began by seeming  to dight the craft for return .   But therewith the haze was grown suddenly  into a low cloud , which came down upon us from the south - west in the arms  of a cold breeze , that grew stronger every minute , so no wonder it was  though the steerer might not keep head to wind ; and then who was afraid  and ashamed save ourselves ?  But the woman said , and there seemed to be a mock in her voice : Ill luck ,  pretty ladies !   Now is there nought for it but to drive , if we would not  drown .   But belike this duskiness will clear presently , and then at least  we shall know whither we be going ; and we may either turn back , or seek  some other shelter , for I know the lake well ; I know , I know .  We were too terror - stricken to speak , for we felt that still the wind  grew stronger , and the lake began to rise into waves , and the craft to  wallow ; but well - nigh therewith was the dusk and the mist gone ; the sky  was bright blue overhead , and the westering sun shone cloudless ; but on  no land it shone , or on aught save the blue waters and the white  wave - crests .  Then wept Aurea , and this Viridis here , but as to me , I grew wroth and  cried out to the steerer : Accursed carline ! thou hast betrayed us ; never  now may we get back to our pavilion till the fight is foughten , and our  lovers will deem that we have forsaken them , and we are shamed for ever .

"<fairy> ”  Chapter IV  The Road Through the Forest  After a few hours the road began to be rough , and the walking grew so  difficult that the Scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks ,  which were here very uneven .
"	"Sometimes , indeed , they were broken or  missing altogether , leaving holes that Toto jumped across and Dorothy  walked around . As for the Scarecrow , having no brains , he walked  straight ahead , and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length  on the hard bricks . It never hurt him , however , and Dorothy would pick  him up and set him upon his feet again , while he joined her in laughing  merrily at his own mishap .  The farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther  back . There were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees , and the farther  they went the more dismal and lonesome the country became .  At noon they sat down by the roadside , near a little brook , and Dorothy  opened her basket and got out some bread . She offered a piece to the  Scarecrow , but he refused .  “ I am never hungry , ” he said , “ and it is a lucky thing I am not , for my  mouth is only painted , and if I should cut a hole in it so I could eat ,  the straw I am stuffed with would come out , and that would spoil the  shape of my head . ”  Dorothy saw at once that this was true , so she only nodded and went on  eating her bread .  “ Tell me something about yourself and the country you came from , ” said  the Scarecrow , when she had finished her dinner . So she told him all  about Kansas , and how gray everything was there , and how the cyclone  had carried her to this queer Land of Oz .  The Scarecrow listened carefully , and said , “ I can not understand why  you should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry ,  gray place you call Kansas . ”  “ That is because you have no brains ” answered the girl . “ No matter how  dreary and gray our homes are , we people of flesh and blood would  rather live there than in any other country , be it ever so beautiful .  There is no place like home . ”  The Scarecrow sighed .  “ Of course I can not understand it , ” he said . “ If your heads were  stuffed with straw , like mine , you would probably all live in the  beautiful places , and then Kansas would have no people at all . It is  fortunate for Kansas that you have brains . ”  “ Wo n’t you tell me a story , while we are resting ? ” asked the

Whoever has a fair lady as his mistress or his wife should  be the better for it , and it is not right that her affection should be  bestowed on him after his worth and reputation are gone .
"	"Surely you ,  too , would have cause to regret her love if you grew soft , for a  woman quickly withdraws her love , and rightly so , and despises him who  degenerates in any way when he has become lord of the realm . Now ought  your fame to be increased ! Slip off the bridle and halter and come to  the tournament with me , that no one may say that you are jealous . Now  you must no longer hesitate to frequent the lists , to share in the  onslaught , and to contend with force , whatever effort it may cost !  Inaction produces indifference . But , really , you must come , for I shall  be in your company . Have a care that our comradeship shall not fail  through any fault of yours , fair companion ; for my part , you may count  on me . It is strange how a man sets store by the life of ease which  has no end . Pleasures grow sweeter through postponement ; and a little  pleasure , when delayed , is much sweeter to the taste than great pleasure  enjoyed at once . The sweets of a love which develops late are like  a fire in a green bush ; for the longer one delays in lighting it the  greater will be the heat it yields , and the longer will its force  endure . One may easily fall into habits which it is very difficult  to shake off , for when one desires to do so , he finds he has lost the  power . Do n't misunderstand my words , my friend : if I had such a fair  mistress as you have , I call God and His saints to witness , I should  leave her most reluctantly ; indeed , I should doubtless be infatuated .  But a man may give another counsel , which he would not take himself ,  just as the preachers , who are deceitful rascals , and preach and  proclaim the right but who do not follow it themselves .

Then Gwawl the son of Clud set out to the  feast that was prepared for him , and he came to the palace , and was  received there with rejoicing .   Pwyll , also , the chief of Annwn came to  the orchard with his hundred knights , as Rhiannon had commanded him ,  having the bag with him .   And Pwyll was clad in coarse and ragged  garments , and wore large clumsy old shoes upon his feet .   And when he  knew that the carousal after the meat had begun , he went towards the  hall , and when he came into the hall , he saluted Gwawl the son of Clud ,  and his company , both men and women .

"<fairy> “ Sleep in ’ em .... ”        STILL ALCOHOLIC        He awoke laughing and his eyes lazily roamed his surroundings ,        evidently a bedroom and bath in a good hotel .
"	"His head was        whirring and picture after picture was forming and blurring and        melting before his eyes , but beyond the desire to laugh he had no        entirely conscious reaction . He reached for the ’ phone beside his        bed .        “ Hello — what hotel is this — ?        “ Knickerbocker ? All right , send up two rye high - balls — ”        He lay for a moment and wondered idly whether they ’d send up a        bottle or just two of those little glass containers . Then , with        an effort , he struggled out of bed and ambled into the bathroom .        When he emerged , rubbing himself lazily with a towel , he found        the bar boy with the drinks and had a sudden desire to kid him .        On reflection he decided that this would be undignified , so he        waved him away .        As the new alcohol tumbled into his stomach and warmed him , the        isolated pictures began slowly to form a cinema reel of the day        before . Again he saw Rosalind curled weeping among the pillows ,        again he felt her tears against his cheek . Her words began        ringing in his ears : “ Do n’t ever forget me , Amory — don’t ever        forget me — ”        “ Hell ! ” he faltered aloud , and then he choked and collapsed on        the bed in a shaken spasm of grief . After a minute he opened his        eyes and regarded the ceiling .        “ Damned fool ! ” he exclaimed in disgust , and with a voluminous        sigh rose and approached the bottle . After another glass he gave        way loosely to the luxury of tears . Purposely he called up into        his mind little incidents of the vanished spring , phrased to        himself emotions that would make him react even more strongly to        sorrow .        “ We were so happy , ” he intoned dramatically , “ so very happy . ”        Then he gave way again and knelt beside the bed , his head        half - buried in the pillow .        “ My own girl — my own — Oh — ”        He clinched his teeth so that the tears streamed in a flood from        his eyes .        “ Oh ... my baby girl , all I had , all I wanted ! ... Oh , my girl ,        come back , come back ! I need you ... need you ... we ’re so pitiful        ... just misery we brought each other .... She ’ll be shut away        from me ....

"<fantasy>  Meanwhile , Sir Tor had made him ready , and followed the knight who rode  away with the hound .
"	"And as he went , there suddenly met him in the road a  dwarf , who struck his horse so viciously upon the head with a great staff ,  that he leaped backwards a spear 's length .  "" Wherefore so smitest thou my horse , foul dwarf ? "" shouted Sir Tor .  "" Because thou shall not pass this way , "" replied the dwarf , "" unless thou  fight for it with yonder knights in those pavilions , "" pointing to two  tents , where two great spears stood out , and two shields hung upon two  trees hard by .  "" I may not tarry , for I am on a quest I needs must follow , "" said Sir Tor .  "" Thou shalt not pass , "" replied the dwarf , and therewith blew his horn .  Then rode out quickly at Sir Tor one armed on horseback , but Sir Tor was  quick as he , and riding at him bore him from his horse , and made him  yield . Directly after came another still more fiercely , but with a few  great strokes and buffets Sir Tor unhorsed him also , and sent them both to  Camelot to King Arthur . Then came the dwarf and begged Sir Tor to take  him in his service , "" for , "" said he , "" I will serve no more recreant  knights . ""  "" Take then a horse , and come with me , "" said Tor .  "" Ride ye after the knight with the white hound ? "" said the dwarf ; "" I can  soon bring ye where he is . ""  So they rode through the forest till they came to two more tents . And Sir  Tor alighting , went into the first , and saw three damsels lie there ,  sleeping . Then went he to the other , and found another lady also sleeping ,  and at her feet the white hound he sought for , which instantly began to  bay and bark so loudly , that the lady woke . But Sir Tor had seized the  hound and given it to the dwarfs charge .  "" What will ye do , Sir knight ? "" cried out the lady ; "" will ye take away my  hound from me by force ? ""  "" Yea , lady , "" said Sir Tor ; "" for so I must , having the king 's command ; and  I have followed it from King Arthur 's court , at Camelot , to this place .

"	" Toward mid - day the gardener ’s son arranged the bones in their places ,  and he had hardly scattered the ashes over them before the old King  revived , to find himself once more young and hearty .  “ How can I reward you , my benefactor ? ” he cried . “ Will you take half my  treasures ? ”  “ No , ” said the gardener ’s son .  “ My daughter ’s hand ? ”  “ _ No _ . ”  “ Take half my kingdom . ”  “ No . Give me only the bronze ring which can instantly grant me anything  I wish for . ”  “ Alas ! ” said the King , “ I set great store by that marvelous ring ;  nevertheless , you shall have it . ” And he gave it to him .  The gardener ’s son went back to say good - by to the old beggar - woman ;  then he said to the bronze ring :  “ Prepare a splendid ship in which I may continue my journey . Let the  hull be of fine gold , the masts of silver , the sails of brocade ; let  the crew consist of twelve young men of noble appearance , dressed like  kings . St. Nicholas will be at the helm . As to the cargo , let it be  diamonds , rubies , emeralds , and carbuncles . ”  And immediately a ship appeared upon the sea which resembled in every  particular the description given by the gardener ’s son , and , stepping  on board , he continued his journey . Presently he arrived at a great town  and established himself in a wonderful palace . After several days he  met his rival , the minister ’s son , who had spent all his money and was  reduced to the disagreeable employment of a carrier of dust and rubbish .  The gardener ’s son said to him :  “ What is your name , what is your family , and from what country do you  come ? ”  “ I am the son of the prime minister of a great nation , and yet see what  a degrading occupation I am reduced to . ”  “ Listen to me ; though I do n’t know anything more about you , I am willing  to help you . I will give you a ship to take you back to your own country  upon one condition . ”  “ Whatever it may be , I accept it willingly . ”  “ Follow me to my palace . ”  The minister ’s son followed the rich stranger , whom he had not  recognized .

"	"They rejoiced , for she was a brave raconteuse , but many        were the keys turned in sideboard locks that night against the        possible defection of little Bobby or Barbara ....        These domestic pilgrimages were invariably in state ; two maids ,        the private car , or Mr. Blaine when available , and very often a        physician . When Amory had the whooping - cough four disgusted        specialists glared at each other hunched around his bed ; when he        took scarlet fever the number of attendants , including physicians        and nurses , totalled fourteen . However , blood being thicker than        broth , he was pulled through .        The Blaines were attached to no city . They were the Blaines of        Lake Geneva ; they had quite enough relatives to serve in place of        friends , and an enviable standing from Pasadena to Cape Cod . But        Beatrice grew more and more prone to like only new acquaintances ,        as there were certain stories , such as the history of her        constitution and its many amendments , memories of her years        abroad , that it was necessary for her to repeat at regular        intervals . Like Freudian dreams , they must be thrown off , else        they would sweep in and lay siege to her nerves . But Beatrice was        critical about American women , especially the floating population        of ex - Westerners .        “ They have accents , my dear , ” she told Amory , “ not Southern        accents or Boston accents , not an accent attached to any        locality , just an accent”—she became dreamy . “ They pick up old ,        moth - eaten London accents that are down on their luck and have to        be used by some one . They talk as an English butler might after        several years in a Chicago grand - opera company . ” She became        almost incoherent—“Suppose — time in every Western woman ’s life — she        feels her husband is prosperous enough for her to        have — accent — they try to impress _ me _ , my dear — ”        Though she thought of her body as a mass of frailties , she        considered her soul quite as ill , and therefore important in her        life . She had once been a Catholic , but discovering that priests        were infinitely more attentive when she was in process of losing        or regaining faith in Mother Church , she maintained an        enchantingly wavering attitude . Often she deplored the bourgeois        quality of the American Catholic clergy , and was quite sure that        had she lived in the shadow of the great Continental cathedrals        her soul would still be a thin flame on the mighty altar of Rome .

"<fairy>  The next night he went off alone , and Nell , finding him gone , followed .
"	" Her grandfather was with the card - players near an encampment of gypsies ,  and , to her horror , he promised to bring more money .  Flight was now the only thing possible , before her grandfather should  steal . How else could he get the money ?  _ IV.--Beyond the Pale _  Flight by water ! For two days they travelled on a barge , Nell sitting  with her grandfather in the boat . Rugged and noisy fellows were the  bargemen , and quite brutal among themselves , though civil enough to  their passengers . The barge floated into the wharf to which it belonged ,  and now came flight by land through a strange , unfriendly town . The  travellers were penniless , and at nightfall took refuge in a deep  doorway .  A man , miserably clad and begrimed with smoke , found them here , and ,  learning they were homeless , promised them shelter by the fire of a  great furnace .  A dark and blackened region was this they were in . On every side tall  chimneys poured out their plague of smoke , and at night the smoke was  changed to fire , and chimneys spurted flame . Struggling vegetation  sickened and sank under the hot breath of kiln and furnace . The  people -- men , women , and children -- wan in their looks and ragged in their  attire , tended the engines , or scowled , half naked , from the doorless  houses .  That night Nell and her grandfather lay down with nothing between them  and the sky . A penny loaf was all they had had that day , and very weak  and spent the child felt .  With morning she was weaker still , and a loathing of food prevented her  sharing the loaf bought with their last penny . Still she dragged her  weary feet on , and only at the very end of the town fell senseless to  the ground .  Once in their earlier wanderings they had made friends with a village  schoolmaster , and now , when all hope seemed gone , it was this  schoolmaster who brought the travellers into a peaceful haven . For it  was he who passed along when little Nell fell fainting to the ground ,  and it was he who carried her into a small inn hard by . A day 's rest  brought some recovery to the child , and in the evening she was able to  sit up .  "" I have made my fortune since I saw you last , "" said the schoolmaster . "" I  have been appointed clerk and schoolmaster to a village a long way from  here at five -

"<fantasy>  So Robert said : ' Yea , mother , he works with his left hand almost as much  as with his right , and sometimes I have seen him change the hammer  suddenly from his right hand to his left , with a kind of half smile , as  one who would say , ' Can not I then ? ' and this more when he does smith 's  work in metal than when he works in marble ; and once I heard him say when  he did so , ' I wonder where my first left hand work is ; ah !   I bide my  time .
"	"'   I wonder also , mother , what he meant by that .

Then  there was Harald , who knew concerning all the stars of heaven and flowers  of earth : Richard , who drew men 's hearts from their bodies , with the  words that swung to and fro in his glorious rhymes : William , to whom the  air of heaven seemed a servant when the harp - strings quivered underneath  his fingers : there were the two sailor - brothers , who the year before ,  young though they were , had come back from a long , perilous voyage , with  news of an island they had found long and long away to the west , larger  than any that this people knew of , but very fair and good , though  uninhabited .  But now over all this noble brotherhood , with its various gifts hung one  cloud of sorrow ; their mother , the Peace - Queen Cissela was dead , she who  had taught them truth and nobleness so well ; she was never to see the  beginning of the end that they would work ; truly it seemed sad .  There sat the seven brothers in the council chamber , waiting for the  king , speaking no word , only thinking drearily ; and under the pavement of  the great church Cissela lay , and by the side of her tomb stood two men ,  old men both , Valdemar the king , and Siur .  So the king , after that he had gazed awhile on the carven face of her he  had loved well , said at last :  ' And now , Sir Carver , must you carve me also to lie there . '   And he  pointed to

"	"""   And therewith she pointed to a place where the  stream ran in a chain of pools and stickles , and a sheer cliff rose up  some fifty paces beyond it , but betwixt the stream and the cliff was a  smooth table of greensward , with three fair thorn bushes thereon , and  it went down at each end to the level of the river 's lip by a green  slope , but amidmost , the little green plain was some ten feet above the  stream , and was broken by a little undercliff , which went down sheer  into the water .   And Ralph saw in the face of the high cliff the mouth  of a cave , however deep it might be .  "" Come , "" said the Lady , "" tarry not , for I know that hunger hath hold of  thee , and look , how low the sun is growing ! "" Then she caught him by the  hand , and fell to running with him to the edge of the stream , where at  the end of the further slope it ran wide and shallow before it entered  into a deep pool overhung with boughs of alder and thorn .   She stepped  daintily over a row of big stones laid in the rippling shallow ; and  staying herself in mid - stream on the biggest of them , and gathering up  her gown , looked up stream with a happy face , and then looked over her  shoulder to Ralph and said : "" The year has been good to me these  seasons , so that when I stayed here on my way to the Castle of  Abundance , I found but few stones washed away , and crossed wellnigh  dry - shod , but this stone my feet are standing on now , I brought down  from under the cliff , and set it amid - most , and I said that when I  brought thee hither I would stay thereon and talk with thee while I  stood above the freshness of the water , as I am doing now .

She approached the window of the room and with one blow of her  golden sword shattered the thick pane of glass . The opening thus  made was large enough for them to swim through if they were careful  not to scrape against the broken points of glass . The queen went  first , followed by Trot and Cap'n Bill , with Clia last of all .  And now they were in the vast dome in which the castle and gardens  of Zog had been built . Around them was a clear stretch of water , and  far above -- full half a mile distant -- was the opening in the roof  guarded by the prince of the sea devils . The mermaid queen had  determined to attack this monster . If she succeeded in destroying it  with her golden sword , the little band of fugitives might then swim  through the opening into the clear waters of the ocean . Although  this prince of the sea devils was said to be big and wise and  mighty , there was but one of him to fight ; whereas , if they  attempted to escape through any of the passages , they must encounter  scores of such enemies .

"<fantasy>  Then all men fell to pitching of tents and tilting over of wains ; for the  April sun was hot in the Dale , and when he arose the meads were gay with  more than the spring flowers ; for the tents and the tilts were stained  and broidered with many colours , and there was none who had not furbished  up his war - gear so that all shone and glittered .
"	"  And many wore gay  surcoats over their armour , and the women were clad in all their bravery ,  and the Houses mostly of a suit ; for one bore blue and another  corn - colour , and another green , and another brazil , and so forth , and all  gleaming and glowing with broidery of gold and bright hues .   But the  women of the Shepherds were all clad in white , embroidered with green  boughs and red blossoms , and the Woodland women wore dark red kirtles .  Moreover , the women had set garlands of flowers on their heads and the  helms of the men , and for the most part they were slim of body and tall  and light - limbed , and as dainty to look upon as the willow - boughs that  waved on the brook - side .  Thither had the goodmen who were guesting the Runaways brought their  guests , even now much bettered by their new soft days ; and much the poor  folk marvelled at all this joyance , and they scarce knew where they were ;  but to some it brought back to their minds days of joyance before the  thralldom and all that they had lost , so that their hearts were heavy a  while , till they saw the warriors of the kindreds streaming into the mead  and bethought them why they carried steel .  Now by then the sun was fully up there was a great throng on the Portway ,  and this was the folk of the Burg on their way to the Weapon - mead .   The  men - at - arms were in the midst of the throng , and at the head of them was  the War - leader , with the banner of the Face before him , wherein was done  the image of the God with the ray - ringed head .   But at the rearward of  the warriors went the Alderman and the Burg - wardens , before whom was  borne the banner of the Burg pictured with the Gate and its Towers ; but  in the midst betwixt those two was the banner of the Steer , a white beast  on a green field .  So when the Dale - wardens who were down in the meadow heard the music and  beheld who were coming , they bade the companies of the Dale and the  Shepherds and the Woodlanders who were down there to pitch their banners  in a half circle about the ingle of the meadow which was made by the  streams of Wildlake and the Weltering Water , and gather to them to be  ordered there under their leaders of scores and half - hundreds and  hundreds ;

"	"  Maybe I shall find the lost once more .   And for the rest ,  in all that this man will do , I will help , living or dead , for I know  naught better to do . ""  "" Again it is well , "" said the Sage , "" and the lost which was verily thine  shalt thou find again , and good days and their ending shall betide  thee .   Ye shall have no shame in your lives and no fear in your deaths .  Wherefore now lieth the road free before you . ""  Then was he silent a while , neither spake the others aught , but stood  gazing on the dark grey plain , and the blue wall that rose beyond it ,  till at last the Sage lifted up his hand and said : "" Look yonder ,  children , to where I point , and ye shall see how there thrusteth out a  ness from the mountain - wall , and the end of it stands like a bastion  above the lava - sea , and on its sides and its head are streaks ruddy and  tawny , where the earth - fires have burnt not so long ago :   see ye ? ""  Ralph looked and said :   "" Yea , father , I see it , and its rifts and its  ridges , and its crannies . ""  Quoth the Sage :   "" Behind that ness shall ye come to the Rock of the  Fighting Man , which is the very Gate of the Mountains ; and I will not  turn again nor bid you farewell till I have brought you thither .   And  now time presses ; for I would have you come timely to that cavern ,  whereof I have taught you , before ye fall on the first days of winter ,  or ye shall be hard bestead .   So now we will eat a morsel , and then use  diligence that we may reach the beginning of the rock - sea before  nightfall . ""  So did they , and the Sage led them down by a slant - way from off the  ridge , which was toilsome but nowise perilous .   So about sunset they  came down into the plain , and found a belt of greensward , and waters  therein betwixt the foot of the ridge and the edge of the rock - sea . And  as for the said sea , though from afar it looked plain and unbroken , now  that they were close to , and on a level with it , they saw that it rose  up into cliffs , broken down in some places , and in others arising high

"<fairy> For ,  reasoning from their daylight behaviour , I thought that fear must be  forgotten .
"	" “ Abruptly , I dashed down the match , and knocking one of the people over  in my course , went blundering across the big dining - hall again , out  under the moonlight . I heard cries of terror and their little feet  running and stumbling this way and that . I do not remember all I did as  the moon crept up the sky . I suppose it was the unexpected nature of my  loss that maddened me . I felt hopelessly cut off from my own kind — a  strange animal in an unknown world . I must have raved to and fro ,  screaming and crying upon God and Fate . I have a memory of horrible  fatigue , as the long night of despair wore away ; of looking in this  impossible place and that ; of groping among moonlit ruins and touching  strange creatures in the black shadows ; at last , of lying on the ground  near the sphinx and weeping with absolute wretchedness , even anger at  the folly of leaving the machine having leaked away with my strength . I  had nothing left but misery . Then I slept , and when I woke again it was  full day , and a couple of sparrows were hopping round me on the turf  within reach of my arm .  “ I sat up in the freshness of the morning , trying to remember how I had  got there , and why I had such a profound sense of desertion and  despair . Then things came clear in my mind . With the plain , reasonable  daylight , I could look my circumstances fairly in the face . I saw the  wild folly of my frenzy overnight , and I could reason with myself .  ‘ Suppose the worst ? ’ I said . ‘ Suppose the machine altogether  lost — perhaps destroyed ? It behoves me to be calm and patient , to learn  the way of the people , to get a clear idea of the method of my loss ,  and the means of getting materials and tools ; so that in the end ,  perhaps , I may make another . ’ That would be my only hope , a poor hope ,  perhaps , but better than despair . And , after all , it was a beautiful  and curious world .  “ But probably the machine had only been taken away . Still , I must be  calm and patient , find its hiding - place , and recover it by force or  cunning . And with that I scrambled to my feet and looked about me ,  wondering where I could bathe . I felt weary , stiff , and travel - soiled .

So that I presently narrated to Gladys the ensuing    _ Story of the Flowery Kingdom _    "" Fair Sou - Chong - Tee , by a shimmering brook    Where ghost - like lilies loomed tall and straight ,    Met young Too - Hi , in a moonlit nook ,    Where they cooed and kissed till the hour was late :    Then , with lanterns , a mandarin passed in state ,    Named Hoo - Hung - Hoo of the Golden Band ,    Who had wooed the maiden to be his mate--    For these things occur in the Flowery Land .

"	"  Next moment the Woozy came dashing back at full speed .  "" There 's a little strip of ground next the wall where there are no  thistles , "" he told them when he had reached the adventurers once more .  "" Now then , friend Hank , see if you can ride as well as the Lion did . ""  "" Take the others first , "" proposed the Mule .   So the Sawhorse and the  Woozy made a couple of trips over the thistles to the city walls and  carried all the people in safety , Dorothy holding little Toto in her  arms .   The travelers then sat in a group on a little hillock just  outside the wall and looked at the great blocks of gray stone and  waited for the Woozy to bring Hank to them .   The Mule was very awkward ,  and his legs trembled so badly that more than once they thought he  would tumble off , but finally he reached them in safety , and the entire  party was now reunited .   More than that , they had reached the city that  had eluded them for so long and in so strange a manner .  "" The gates must be around the other side , "" said the Wizard .   "" Let us  follow the curve of the wall until we reach an opening in it . ""  "" Which way ? "" asked Dorothy .  "" We must guess that , "" he replied .   "" Suppose we go to the left .   One  direction is as good as another . ""   They formed in marching order and  went around the city wall to the left .   It was n't a big city , as I have  said , but to go way around it outside the high wall was quite a walk ,  as they became aware .   But around it our adventurers went without  finding any sign of a gateway or other opening .   When they had returned  to the little mound from which they had started , they dismounted from  the animals and again seated themselves on the grassy mound .  "" It 's mighty queer , is n't it ?

"	" “ How wildly we romped ! ” says Mrs. Darling now , recalling it .  “ Our last romp ! ” Mr. Darling groaned .  “ O George , do you remember Michael suddenly said to me , ‘ How did you  get to know me , mother ? ’ ”  “ I remember ! ”  “ They were rather sweet , do n’t you think , George ? ”  “ And they were ours , ours ! and now they are gone . ”  The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana , and most unluckily Mr.  Darling collided against her , covering his trousers with hairs . They  were not only new trousers , but they were the first he had ever had  with braid on them , and he had had to bite his lip to prevent the tears  coming . Of course Mrs. Darling brushed him , but he began to talk again  about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse .  “ George , Nana is a treasure . ”  “ No doubt , but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon  the children as puppies . ”  “ Oh no , dear one , I feel sure she knows they have souls . ”  “ I wonder , ” Mr. Darling said thoughtfully , “ I wonder . ” It was an  opportunity , his wife felt , for telling him about the boy . At first he  pooh - poohed the story , but he became thoughtful when she showed him the  shadow .  “ It is nobody I know , ” he said , examining it carefully , “ but it does  look a scoundrel . ”  “ We were still discussing it , you remember , ” says Mr. Darling , “ when  Nana came in with Michael ’s medicine . You will never carry the bottle  in your mouth again , Nana , and it is all my fault . ”  Strong man though he was , there is no doubt that he had behaved rather  foolishly over the medicine . If he had a weakness , it was for thinking  that all his life he had taken medicine boldly , and so now , when  Michael dodged the spoon in Nana ’s mouth , he had said reprovingly , “ Be  a man , Michael . ”  “ Wo n’t ; wo n’t ! ” Michael cried naughtily .

"	"At the  farther extremity of this hall , approaching slowly towards him , Cadmus  beheld a female figure , wonderfully beautiful , and adorned with a royal  robe , and a crown of diamonds over her golden ringlets , and the richest  necklace that ever a queen wore . His heart thrilled with delight . He  fancied it his long - lost sister Europa , now grown to womanhood , coming  to make him happy , and to repay him with her sweet sisterly affection ,  for all those weary wonderings in quest of her since he left King  Agenor 's palace -- for the tears that he had shed , on parting with  Phoenix , and Cilix , and Thasus -- for the heart - breakings that had made  the whole world seem dismal to him over his dear mother 's grave .  But , as Cadmus advanced to meet the beautiful stranger , he saw that  her features were unknown to him , although , in the little time that it  required to tread along the hall , he had already felt a sympathy betwixt  himself and her .  "" No , Cadmus , "" said the same voice that had spoken to him in the field of  the armed men , "" this is not that dear sister Europa whom you have sought  so faithfully all over the wide world . This is Harmonia , a daughter of  the sky , who is given you instead of sister , and brothers , and friend ,  and mother . You will find all those dear ones in her alone . ""  So King Cadmus dwelt in the palace , with his new friend Harmonia ,  and found a great deal of comfort in his magnificent abode , but would  doubtless have found as much , if not more , in the humblest cottage by  the wayside . Before many years went by , there was a group of rosy little  children ( but how they came thither has always been a mystery to me )  sporting in the great hall , and on the marble steps of the palace , and  running joyfully to meet King Cadmus when affairs of state left him at  leisure to play with them . They called him father , and Queen Harmonia  mother . The five old soldiers of the dragon 's teeth grew very fond  of these small urchins , and were never weary of showing them how to  shoulder sticks , flourish wooden swords , and march in military order ,  blowing a penny trumpet , or beating an abominable rub - a - dub upon a  little drum .

How much did you get for her ? ”  “ You 'll never guess , mother , ” says Jack .  “ No , you do n't say so . Good boy ! Five pounds , ten , fifteen , no , it ca n't  be twenty . ”  “ I told you you could n't guess , what do you say to these beans ; they 're  magical , plant them over - night and---- ”  “ What ! ” says Jack 's mother , “ have you been such a fool , such a dolt ,  such an idiot , as to give away my Milky - white , the best milker in the  parish , and prime beef to boot , for a set of paltry beans . Take that !  Take that ! Take that ! And as for your precious beans here they go out of  the window . And now off with you to bed . Not a sup shall you drink , and  not a bit shall you swallow this very night . ”  So Jack went upstairs to his little room in the attic , and sad and sorry  he was , to be sure , as much for his mother 's sake , as for the loss of  his supper .  At last he dropped off to sleep .  When he woke up , the room looked so funny . The sun was shining into part  of it , and yet all the rest was quite dark and shady . So Jack jumped  up and dressed himself and went to the window . And what do you think  he saw ? why , the beans his mother had thrown out of the window into the  garden , had sprung up into a big beanstalk which went up and up and up  till it reached the sky . So the man spoke truth after all .  The beanstalk grew up quite close past Jack 's window , so all he had to  do was to open it and give a jump on to the beanstalk which was made  like a big plaited ladder . So Jack climbed and he climbed and he climbed  and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed till at last  he reached the sky . And when he got there he found a long broad road  going as straight as a dart . So he walked along and he walked along  and he walked along till he came to a great big tall house , and on the  doorstep there was a great big tall

Then go and open the  skylight,--mind , I say OPEN THE SKYLIGHT,--set yourself down in the  middle of it , like a frog on a water - lily leaf ; say ' Abracadabra , dum  dum dum , ' and -- see what will happen ! ”  The Prince burst into a fit of laughing . It all seemed so exceedingly  silly ; he wondered that a wise old woman like his godmother should talk  such nonsense .  “ Stuff - and - nonsense , you mean , ” said she , answering , to his great alarm ,  his unspoken thoughts . “ Did I not tell you some people called me by that  name ? Never mind ; it does n't harm me . ”  And she laughed -- her merry laugh -- as child - like as if she were the  Prince 's age instead of her own , whatever that might be . She certainly  was a most extraordinary old woman .  “ Believe me or not , it does n't matter , ” said she . “ Here is the cloak :  when you want to go traveling on it , say ' Abracadabra , dum , dum , dum ' ;  when you want to come back again , say ' Abracadabra , tum tum ti . ' That 's  all ; good - by . ”  A puff of most pleasant air passing by him , and making him feel for the  moment quite strong and well , was all the Prince was conscious of . His  most extraordinary godmother was gone .  “ Really now , how rosy your Royal Highness ' cheeks have grown ! You seem  to have got well already , ” said the nurse , entering the room .  “ I think I have , ” replied the Prince very gently -- he felt gently and  kindly even to his grim nurse . “ And now let me have my dinner , and go  you to your sewing as usual . ”  The instant she was gone , however , taking with her the plates and  dishes , which for the first time since his illness he had satisfactorily  cleared , Prince Dolor sprang down from his sofa , and with one or two  of his frog - like jumps reached the cupboard where he kept his toys , and  looked everywhere for his traveling - cloak .  Alas ! it was not there .  While he was ill of the doldrums , his nurse , thinking it a good  opportunity for putting things to rights , had made

"<fairy> And if anyone had added  that Aglaya ’s note was a love - letter , and that it contained an  appointment to a lover ’s rendezvous , he would have blushed with shame  for the speaker , and , probably , have challenged him to a duel .
"	" All this would have been perfectly sincere on his part . He had never  for a moment entertained the idea of the possibility of this girl  loving him , or even of such a thing as himself falling in love with  her . The possibility of being loved himself , “ a man like me , ” as he put  it , he ranked among ridiculous suppositions . It appeared to him that it  was simply a joke on Aglaya ’s part , if there really were anything in it  at all ; but that seemed to him quite natural . His preoccupation was  caused by something different .  As to the few words which the general had let slip about Aglaya  laughing at everybody , and at himself most of all — he entirely believed  them . He did not feel the slightest sensation of offence ; on the  contrary , he was quite certain that it was as it should be .  His whole thoughts were now as to next morning early ; he would see her ;  he would sit by her on that little green bench , and listen to how  pistols were loaded , and look at her . He wanted nothing more .  The question as to what she might have to say of special interest to  himself occurred to him once or twice . He did not doubt , for a moment ,  that she really had some such subject of conversation in store , but so  very little interested in the matter was he that it did not strike him  to wonder what it could be . The crunch of gravel on the path suddenly  caused him to raise his head .  A man , whose face it was difficult to see in the gloom , approached the  bench , and sat down beside him . The prince peered into his face , and  recognized the livid features of Rogojin .  “ I knew you ’d be wandering about somewhere here . I did n’t have to look  for you very long , ” muttered the latter between his teeth .  It was the first time they had met since the encounter on the staircase  at the hotel .  Painfully surprised as he was at this sudden apparition of Rogojin , the  prince , for some little while , was unable to collect his thoughts .  Rogojin , evidently , saw and understood the impression he had made ; and  though he seemed more or less confused at first , yet he began talking  with what looked like assumed ease and freedom . However , the prince  soon changed his mind on this score , and thought that there was not  only no affectation of indifference ,

When the King ’s son awoke the fish - pond was done . Then the King ’s  daughter went away also , and told him that when it was six he was to  come to the house . When he arrived at the house the King asked , “ Hast  thou got the fish - pond done ? ” “ Yes , ” said the King ’s son . That was very  good .  When they were again sitting at table the King said , “ Thou hast  certainly done the fish - pond , but I can not give thee my daughter yet ;  thou must just do one thing more . ” “ What is that , then ? ” asked the  King ’s son . The King said he had a great mountain on which there was  nothing but briars which must all be cut down , and at the top of it the  youth must build up a great castle , which must be as strong as could be  conceived , and all the furniture and fittings belonging to a castle  must be inside it . And when he arose next morning the King gave him a  glass axe and a glass gimlet with him , and he was to have all done by  six o’clock . As he was cutting down the first briar with the axe , it  broke off short , and so small that the pieces flew all round about , and  he could not use the gimlet either . Then he was quite miserable , and  waited for his dearest to see if she would not come and help him in his  need . When it was mid - day she came and brought him something to eat . He  went to meet her and told her all , and ate something , and let her comb  his hair and fell asleep . Then she once more took the knot and struck  the earth with it , and said , “ Earth - workers , come forth ! ” Then came  once again numbers of earth - men , and asked what her desire was . Then  said she , “ In the space of three hours they must cut down the whole of  the briars , and a castle must be built on the top of the mountain that  must be as strong as any one could conceive , and all the furniture that

In short ,  everything succeeded so well that the youngest daughter began to think  the master of the house not to have a beard so very blue , and that he  was a mighty civil gentleman .  As soon as they returned home , the marriage was concluded . About a  month afterward , Blue Beard told his wife that he was obliged to take  a country journey for six weeks at least , about affairs of very great  consequence , desiring her to divert herself in his absence , to send for  her friends and acquaintances , to carry them into the country , if she  pleased , and to make good cheer wherever she was .  “ Here , ” said he , “ are the keys of the two great wardrobes , wherein I  have my best furniture ; these are of my silver and gold plate , which is  not every day in use ; these open my strong boxes , which hold my money ,  both gold and silver ; these my caskets of jewels ; and this is the  master - key to all my apartments . But for this little one here , it is the  key of the closet at the end of the great gallery on the ground floor .  Open them all ; go into all and every one of them , except that little  closet , which I forbid you , and forbid it in such a manner that , if you  happen to open it , there ’s nothing but what you may expect from my just  anger and resentment . ”  She promised to observe , very exactly , whatever he had ordered ; when  he , after having embraced her , got into his coach and proceeded on his  journey .

When he got to the meadow ,  he perceived his old friend the stork , who was walking backwards and  forwards like a philosopher . Sometimes he stood still , took a frog into  close consideration , and at length swallowed it down . The stork came to  him and greeted him . “ I see , ” he began , “ that thou hast thy pack on thy  back . Why art thou leaving the town ? ” The tailor told him what the King  had required of him , and how he could not perform it , and lamented his  misfortune . “ Do n’t let thy hair grow grey about that , ” said the stork ,  “ I will help thee out of thy difficulty . For a long time now , I have  carried the children in swaddling - clothes into the town , so for once in  a way I can fetch a little prince out of the well . Go home and be easy .  In nine days from this time repair to the royal palace , and there will  I come . ” The little tailor went home , and at the appointed time was at  the castle . It was not long before the stork came flying thither and  tapped at the window . The tailor opened it , and cousin Longlegs came  carefully in , and walked with solemn steps over the smooth marble  pavement . He had , moreover , a baby in his beak that was as lovely as an  angel , and stretched out its little hands to the Queen . The stork laid  it in her lap , and she caressed it and kissed it , and was beside  herself with delight . Before the stork flew away , he took his  travelling bag off his back and handed it over to the Queen . In it  there were little paper parcels with colored sweetmeats , and they were  divided amongst the little princesses . The eldest , however , had none of  them , but got the merry tailor for a husband . “ It seems to me , ” said  he , “ just as if I had won the highest prize .

"	"It seemed to the man that his hand in particular wanted to  rest . It was luxury not to work with it . It was good to lay it down on  a sheet of paper with the pen sloping against his finger , and then watch  his hand going to sleep -- it seemed to the man that it was his hand  and not himself wanted to sleep , but it always awakened when the pen  slipped . There was an instinct in him somewhere not to let the pen  slip , and every time the pen moved his hand awakened , and began to work  languidly . When he went home at night he lay down at once and stared  for hours at a fly on the wall or a crack on the ceiling . When his wife  spoke to him he heard her speaking as from a great distance , and he  answered her dully as though he was replying through a cloud . He only  wanted to be let alone , to be allowed to stare at the fly on the wall ,  or the crack on the ceiling .  “ One morning he found that he could n’t get up , or rather , that he did n’t  want to get up . When his wife called him he made no reply , and she  seemed to call him every ten seconds -- the words , ‘ get up , get up , ’ were  crackling all round him ; they were bursting like bombs on the right hand  and on the left of him : they were scattering from above and all around  him , bursting upwards from the floor , swirling , swaying , and jostling  each other . Then the sounds ceased , and one voice only said to him  ‘ You are late ! ’ He saw these words like a blur hanging in the air , just  beyond his eyelids , and he stared at the blur until he fell asleep . ”  The voice in the cell ceased speaking for a few minutes , and then it  went on again .  “ For three weeks the man did not leave his bed -- he lived faintly in a  kind of trance , wherein great forms moved about slowly and immense  words were drumming gently for ever . When he began to take notice again  everything in the house was different . Most of the furniture , paid for  so hardly , was gone . He missed a thing everywhere -- chairs , a mirror ,  a table : wherever he looked he missed something ; and downstairs was  worse -- there , everything was gone .

There then sat Geoffrey at the banquet ; and Christopher smiled on him ,  and said : "" See now , lord , if I have not done as thou badest when  thou gavest me the treasure of Greenharbour , for I have brought the  wolf - heads to thy helping and not to thy scathing .

But a seven days thence was  the Allmen 's Mote gathered to the wood - side without Meadhamstead , and  thronged it was : and there Goldilind stood up before all the folk  and named Sir Geoffrey for Earl to rule the land under her , and none  gainsaid it , for they knew him meet thereto . Then she named from the  baronage and knighthood such men as she had been truly told were meet  thereto to all the offices of the kingdom , and there was none whom  she named but was well - pleasing to the folk ; for she had taken counsel  beforehand with all the wisest men of all degrees .  As for herself , all loved and worshipped her ; and this alone seemed hard  unto them , that she must needs go back to Oakenrealm in a few days : but  when she heard them murmur thereat , she behight them , that once in every  year she would come into Meadham and spend one whole month therein ; and ,  were it possible , ever should that be the month of May . So when they  heard that , they all praised her , and were the more content . This custom  she kept ever thereafter , and she lay in with her second son in the city  of Meadhamstead , so that he was born therein ; and she named him to be  King after her , to the great joy of that folk ; and he grew up strong and  well - liking , and came to the kingship while his mother was yet alive ,  and was a good man and well - beloved of his folk .

"	"The Cat cunningly  resolved to destroy this chance - made colony . To carry out her design ,  she climbed to the nest of the Eagle , and said , “ Destruction is  preparing for you , and for me too , unfortunately . The Wild Sow , whom you  see daily digging up the earth , wishes to uproot the oak , so she may  on its fall seize our families as food for her young . ” Having thus  frightened the Eagle out of her senses , she crept down to the cave of  the Sow , and said , “ Your children are in great danger ; for as soon  as you go out with your litter to find food , the Eagle is prepared to  pounce upon one of your little pigs . ” Having instilled these fears into  the Sow , she went and pretended to hide herself in the hollow of the  tree . When night came she went forth with silent foot and obtained  food for herself and her kittens , but feigning to be afraid , she kept a  lookout all through the day . Meanwhile , the Eagle , full of fear of the  Sow , sat still on the branches , and the Sow , terrified by the Eagle , did  not dare to go out from her cave .

As the conversation began to flag , the Thief yawned  terribly and at the same time howled like a wolf . The Innkeeper said ,  “ Why do you howl so fearfully ? ” “ I will tell you , ” said the Thief , “ but  first let me ask you to hold my clothes , or I shall tear them to pieces .  I know not , sir , when I got this habit of yawning , nor whether these  attacks of howling were inflicted on me as a judgment for my crimes , or  for any other cause ; but this I do know , that when I yawn for the third  time , I actually turn into a wolf and attack men . ” With this speech he  commenced a second fit of yawning and again howled like a wolf ,

For this purpose he called for a cup , and while filling it with water ,  pretended to mix poison with the Cobbler ’s antidote , commanding him  to drink it on the promise of a reward . The Cobbler , under the fear of  death , confessed that he had no knowledge of medicine , and was only made  famous by the stupid clamors of the crowd .

"<fairy>  The perpendicular parts of this side ladder , as is usually the case  with swinging ones , were of cloth - covered rope , only the rounds were of  wood , so that at every step there was a joint .
"	"At my first glimpse of  the pulpit , it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship ,  these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary . For I was not  prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height , slowly turn  round , and stooping over the pulpit , deliberately drag up the ladder  step by step , till the whole was deposited within , leaving him  impregnable in his little Quebec .  I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this .  Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and  sanctity , that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any  mere tricks of the stage . No , thought I , there must be some sober  reason for this thing ; furthermore , it must symbolize something unseen .  Can it be , then , that by that act of physical isolation , he signifies  his spiritual withdrawal for the time , from all outward worldly ties  and connexions ? Yes , for replenished with the meat and wine of the  word , to the faithful man of God , this pulpit , I see , is a  self - containing stronghold — a lofty Ehrenbreitstein , with a perennial  well of water within the walls .  But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place ,  borrowed from the chaplain ’s former sea - farings . Between the marble  cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit , the wall which formed its back  was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating  against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy  breakers . But high above the flying scud and dark - rolling clouds , there  floated a little isle of sunlight , from which beamed forth an angel ’s  face ; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the  ship ’s tossed deck , something like that silver plate now inserted into  the Victory ’s plank where Nelson fell . “ Ah , noble ship , ” the angel  seemed to say , “ beat on , beat on , thou noble ship , and bear a hardy  helm ; for lo ! the sun is breaking through ; the clouds are rolling  off — serenest azure is at hand . ”  Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea - taste that  had achieved the ladder and the picture . Its panelled front was in the  likeness of a ship ’s bluff bows , and the Holy Bible rested on a  projecting piece of scroll work , fashioned after a ship ’s fiddle - headed  beak .

And I stayed very quiet a time , and afterward I went upward again of the  Gorge , and did use a new caution to my way , and saw that the Diskos was  free upon my hip ; for even thus I did carry the weapon , being that I  must use both hands to my way , and to save me in my stumblings and  slidings over the slippery rocks .  And once it did seem to me that some great thing moved in the darkness ,  and I went downward among the rocks , and stirred not my body for a great  while ; and sure am I that there went some living monster past me , that  did stink as a loathsome grave . And afterward , I went on again .  And three hours did I go thus , and came at last to a place where a  fire - hole did shine more ruddy ; and I did look well about me , that I  should perceive that part of the Gorge the better . And as I stood there ,  very quiet , away off from the fire , so that it did show no great light  upon my person , I did note how utter still was that place ; and this to  take me anew , as though it had come fresh upon me . And here , there would  be the drip of water , and again in that place , and again elsewhere ; and  all very solemn and very dismal . And the silence to be constant .  And presently , as I lookt , now to this way and again to that , I saw that  there was a monstrous slug - thing laid upward against the black side of  the Gorge , as that it had stood up on end ; and the one end of the  monster went upward beyond the light from the fire - pit ; but the other  part did come down and trail into the Gorge , as a long hillock , very  ugly and black and beslimed .  And I near sweat with a disgust and horror of the thing ; but afterward I  had more courage , and spied well upon the brute . And surely , it moved  not at all , any more than the side of the cliff of the Gorge ; and I  conceived that it stood not upward upon any feet ; but clung to the rock ,  even as you shall see

The  Wolf , having shown himself an apt pupil , said to the Shepherd , “ Since  you have taught me to steal , you must keep a sharp lookout , or you will  lose some of your own flock . ”  The Father and His Two Daughters  A MAN had two daughters , the one married to a gardener , and the other to  a tile - maker . After a time he went to the daughter who had married the  gardener , and inquired how she was and how all things went with her . She  said , “ All things are prospering with me , and I have only one wish , that  there may be a heavy fall of rain , in order that the plants may be well  watered . ” Not long after , he went to the daughter who had married the  tilemaker , and likewise inquired of her how she fared ; she replied ,  “ I want for nothing , and have only one wish , that the dry weather may  continue , and the sun shine hot and bright , so that the bricks might be  dried . ” He said to her , “ If your sister wishes for rain , and you for dry  weather , with which of the two am I to join my wishes ? ”  The Farmer and His Sons  A FATHER , being on the point of death , wished to be sure that his sons  would give the same attention to his farm as he himself had given it .

"	" They sat now in a row facing the prince , and frowned , and played with  their caps . All appeared ready to speak , and yet all were silent ; the  defiant expression on their faces seemed to say , “ No , sir , you do n’t  take us in ! ” It could be felt that the first word spoken by anyone  present would bring a torrent of speech from the whole deputation .  VIII .  “ I _ did _ not expect you , gentlemen , ” began the prince . “ I have been ill  until to - day . A month ago , ” he continued , addressing himself to Antip  Burdovsky , “ I put your business into Gavrila Ardalionovitch Ivolgin ’s  hands , as I told you then . I do not in the least object to having a  personal interview ... but you will agree with me that this is hardly  the time ... I propose that we go into another room , if you will not  keep me long ... As you see , I have friends here , and believe me ... ”  “ Friends as many as you please , but allow me , ” interrupted the harsh  voice of Lebedeff ’s nephew—“allow me to tell you that you might have  treated us rather more politely , and not have kept us waiting at least  two hours ...  “ No doubt ... and I ... is that acting like a prince ? And you ... you may  be a general ! But I ... I am not your valet ! And I ... I ... ” stammered  Antip Burdovsky .  He was extremely excited ; his lips trembled , and the resentment of an  embittered soul was in his voice . But he spoke so indistinctly that  hardly a dozen words could be gathered .  “ It was a princely action ! ” sneered Hippolyte .  “ If anyone had treated me so , ” grumbled the boxer .  “ I mean to say that if I had been in Burdovsky ’s place ... I ... ”  “ Gentlemen , I did not know you were there ; I have only just been  informed , I assure you , ” repeated Muishkin .  “ We are not afraid of your friends , prince , ” remarked Lebedeff ’s  nephew , “ for we are within our rights . ”  The shrill tones of Hippolyte interrupted him . “ What right have you ...  by what right do you demand us to submit this matter , about  Burdovsky ... to the judgment of your friends ? We know only too well  what the judgment of your friends will be ! ... ”  This beginning

"<fairy> The two friends did not  seem ever to be parted for a moment .
"	" Occasionally the prince heard loud talking and laughing upstairs , and  once he detected the sound of a jolly soldier ’s song going on above ,  and recognized the unmistakable bass of the general ’s voice . But the  sudden outbreak of song did not last ; and for an hour afterwards the  animated sound of apparently drunken conversation continued to be heard  from above . At length there was the clearest evidence of a grand mutual  embracing , and someone burst into tears . Shortly after this , however ,  there was a violent but short - lived quarrel , with loud talking on both  sides .  All these days Colia had been in a state of great mental preoccupation .  Muishkin was usually out all day , and only came home late at night . On  his return he was invariably informed that Colia had been looking for  him . However , when they did meet , Colia never had anything particular  to tell him , excepting that he was highly dissatisfied with the general  and his present condition of mind and behaviour .  “ They drag each other about the place , ” he said , “ and get drunk  together at the pub close by here , and quarrel in the street on the way  home , and embrace one another after it , and do n’t seem to part for a  moment . ”  When the prince pointed out that there was nothing new about that , for  that they had always behaved in this manner together , Colia did not  know what to say ; in fact he could not explain what it was that  specially worried him , just now , about his father .  On the morning following the bacchanalian songs and quarrels recorded  above , as the prince stepped out of the house at about eleven o’clock ,  the general suddenly appeared before him , much agitated .  “ I have long sought the honour and opportunity of meeting  you — much - esteemed Lef Nicolaievitch , ” he murmured , pressing the  prince ’s hand very hard , almost painfully so ; “ long — very long . ”  The prince begged him to step in and sit down .  “ No — I will not sit down,—I am keeping you , I see,—another time!—I think  I may be permitted to congratulate you upon the realization of your  heart ’s best wishes , is it not so ? ”  “ What best wishes ? ”  The prince blushed . He thought , as so many in his position do , that  nobody had seen , heard , noticed , or understood anything .  “ Oh — be easy , sir , be easy

"	"""  At that Sir Clamadius was very glad , for he feared that Sir Percival might  be some famous knight well - seasoned in arms . Wherefore when he found that  Sir Percival was only a young and untried knight , he thought it would be an  easy matter to deal with him . So he said : "" Messire , I challenge thee to  come forth to battle with me man to man so that thou and I may settle this  quarrel betwixt us , for it is a pity to shed more blood than is necessary  in this quarrel . So if thou wilt come forth and overthrow me , then I will  withdraw my people from this place ; but if I overthrow thee , then this  castle shall be yielded up to me with all that it contains . ""  To this Sir Percival said : "" Sir Knight , I am very willing to fight with  thee upon that issue . But first of all I must obtain the consent of the  Lady Blanchefleur to stand her champion . ""  So Sir Percival went to the Lady Blanchefleur , and he said : "" Lady , will you  accept me as your champion to fight the issue of this quarrel man to man  with Sir Clamadius ? ""  She said : "" Percival , thou art very young to have to do with so old and  well - seasoned a knight . Now I greatly fear for your life in such a battle  as that . ""  To this Sir Percival said : "" Lady , I know that I am young , but indeed I feel  a very big spirit stir within me , so that if thou wilt trust me , I have  belief that , with the grace of God , I shall win this battle . ""  Then the Lady Blanchefleur smiled upon Sir Percival and she said :  "" Percival , I will gladly entrust my life and safety into thy keeping , for I  too have great dependence in thy knighthood . ""  So straightway Sir Percival armed himself , and when he was in all wise  prepared he went forth to that battle with a heart very full of great  courage and hope .  There he found Sir Clamadius still parading in that meadow beneath the  walls , awaiting the coming of his opponent .  [ Sidenote : Sir Percival and Sir Clamadius do battle ] Meanwhile many folk  came and stood upon the walls of the castle to behold that encounter ,  whilst each knight took such stand as appeared good to him .

""  Adelaide rubbed her nose . "" Did I promise eternal fidelity ? I can hardly  remember that far back .

"<fantasy> Fierce is the clash of the swords , as they rain great blows  upon neck and shoulders .
"	"For this is no mere sport : they break whatever  they touch , cutting the shields and shattering the hauberks . The swords  are red with crimson blood . Long the battle lasts ; but they fight so  lustily that they become weary and listless . Both the damsels are in  tears , and each knight sees his lady weep and raise her hands to God and  pray that He may give the honours of the battle to the one who strives  for her . "" Ha ! vassal , "" quoth the knight to Erec , "" let us withdraw and  rest a little ; for too weak are these blows we deal . We must deal better  blows than these ; for now it draws near evening . It is shameful and  highly discreditable that this battle should last so long . See yonder  that gentle maid who weeps for thee and calls on God . Full sweetly she  prays for thee , as does also mine for me . Surely we should do our best  with our blades of steel for the sake of our lady - loves . "" Erec replies :  "" You have spoken well . "" Then they take a little rest , Erec looking  toward his lady as she softly prays for him . While he sat and looked  on her , great strength was recruited within him . Her love and beauty  inspired him with great boldness . He remembered the Queen , to whom he  pledged his word that he would avenge the insult done him , or would make  it greater yet . "" Ah ! wretch , "" says he , "" why do I wait ? I have not yet  taken vengeance for the injury which this vassal permitted when his  dwarf struck me in the wood . "" His anger is revived within him as he  summons the knight : "" Vassal , "" quoth he , "" I call you to battle anew . Too  long we have rested ; let us now renew our strife . "" And he replies : "" That  is no hardship to me . "" Whereupon , they again fall upon each other .  They were both expert fencers . At his first lunge the knight would have  wounded Erec had he not skilfully parried . Even so , he smote him so  hard over the shield beside his temple that he struck a piece from his  helmet . Closely shaving his white coif , the sword descends , cleaving the  shield through to the buckle , and cutting more than a span from the side  of his hauberk . Then he must have been well stunned , as the cold steel  penetrated to the flesh on his thigh

"<fairy> But the King replied : “ I have seen the whole castle , and shall  find out what is in there ” ; and with these words he approached the door  and wanted to force it open .
"	"But Trusty John held him back , and said : “ I  promised your father before his death that you should n’t see what that  room contains . It might bring both you and me to great grief . ” “ Ah !  no , ” answered the young King ; “ if I do n’t get in , it will be my certain  destruction ; I should have no peace night or day till I had seen what  was in the room with my own eyes . Now I do n’t budge from the spot till  you have opened the door . ”  Then Trusty John saw there was no way out of it , so with a heavy heart  and many sighs he took the key from the big bunch . When he had opened  the door he stepped in first , and thought to cover the likeness so that  the King might not perceive it ; but it was hopeless : the King stood on  tiptoe and looked over his shoulder . And when he saw the picture of the  maid , so beautiful and glittering with gold and precious stones , he fell  swooning to the ground . Trusty John lifted him up , carried him to bed ,  and thought sorrowfully : “ The curse has come upon us ; gracious heaven !  what will be the end of it all ? ” Then he poured wine down his throat  till he came to himself again . The first words he spoke were : “ Oh ! who  is the original of the beautiful picture ? ” “ She is the Princess of the  Golden Roof , ” answered Trusty John . Then the King continued : “ My love  for her is so great that if all the leaves on the trees had tongues they  could not express it ; my very life depends on my winning her . You are my  most trusty John : you must stand by me . ”  The faithful servant pondered long how they were to set about the  matter , for it was said to be difficult even to get into the presence of  the Princess . At length he hit upon a plan , and spoke to the King : “ All  the things she has about her -- tables , chairs , dishes , goblets , bowls ,  and all her household furniture -- are made of gold . You have in  your treasure five tons of gold ; let the goldsmiths of your kingdom  manufacture them into all manner of vases and vessels , into all sorts of  birds and game and wonderful beasts ; that will please her .

"	" You can easily imagine how delighted he was when he heard the news ,  and how angry it made all the other kings to lose for ever the hope of  marrying the Princess ; but , after all , Bellissima could not have married  twenty kings -- indeed , she had found it quite difficult enough to choose  one , for her vanity made her believe that there was nobody in the world  who was worthy of her .  Preparations were begun at once for the grandest wedding that had ever  been held at the palace . The King of the Gold Mines sent such immense  sums of money that the whole sea was covered with the ships that brought  it . Messengers were sent to all the gayest and most refined Courts ,  particularly to the Court of France , to seek out everything rare and  precious to adorn the Princess , although her beauty was so perfect that  nothing she wore could make her look prettier . At least that is what  the King of the Gold Mines thought , and he was never happy unless he was  with her .  As for the Princess , the more she saw of the King the more she liked  him ; he was so generous , so handsome and clever , that at last she was  almost as much in love with him as he was with her . How happy they were  as they wandered about in the beautiful gardens together , sometimes  listening to sweet music ! And the King used to write songs for  Bellissima . This is one that she liked very much :    In the forest all is gay    When my Princess walks that way .    All the blossoms then are found    Downward fluttering to the ground ,    Hoping she may tread on them .    And bright flowers on slender stem    Gaze up at her as she passes    Brushing lightly through the grasses .    Oh ! my Princess , birds above    Echo back our songs of love ,    As through this enchanted land    Blithe we wander , hand in hand .  They really were as happy as the day was long . All the King ’s  unsuccessful rivals had gone home in despair . They said good - by to the  Princess so sadly that she could not help being sorry for them .  “ Ah ! madam , ” the King of the Gold Mines said to her “ how is this ? Why  do you waste your pity on these princes , who love you so much that all  their trouble would be well repaid by a single smile from you ? ”  “ I should be sorry , ” answered Bellissima ,

When he had been gone some time his mother said she felt better , and  requested the neighbours to return to their homes , as she wished to  sleep ; but as soon as they were out of earshot she got up and prepared  a savoury meal for him whom she thought her husband .  PART V  U Babam Doh , eager to see his mother healed , walked without halting  till he came to a dense and uninhabited part of the forest which  he thought might be the haunt of wild beasts , but he could see no  trail of tigers . He was about to return home after a fruitless hunt ,  as he feared to be absent too long from his mother , when he heard  loud moans from behind a near thicket . He immediately directed his  steps towards the sound , prepared to render what assistance he could  to whoever was suffering . To his surprise he found some young tiger  cubs , one of whom had swallowed a bone , which had stuck in his throat ,  and was choking him . U Babam Doh quickly made a pair of pincers from  a piece of bamboo , and soon had the bone removed . The cubs were very  thankful for the recovery of their brother , and showed their gratitude  by purring and licking U Babam Doh 's hand , while the cub from whose  throat the bone was extracted crouched at his feet , declaring that  he would be his attendant for ever .  U Babam Doh took up his lota and his bow and prepared to depart , but  the cubs entreated him to stay until their mother returned , so as to  get her permission for the young tiger to follow him . So U Babam Doh  stayed with the cubs to await the return of the tigress .  Before long the muffled sound of her tread was heard approaching . As  she drew near , she sniffed the air suspiciously , and soon detected  the presence of a man in her lair . Putting herself in a fighting  attitude , she began to growl loudly , saying , "" Human flesh , human  flesh "" ; but the cubs ran to meet her , and told her how a kind man had  saved their brother from death . Whereupon she stopped her growling ,  and , like her cubs , she

"<fairy>  Next morning they returned early to their work , but , to their  consternation , they saw that the incisions made by them the day before  at the cost of so much labour were obliterated , leaving the trunk of  the tree as solid and unscathed as before .
"	"Many of the wood - cutters  were so superstitious that they feared to approach the tree again , for  they were now confirmed in their fear that the place was enchanted ; but  when their more stoical comrades reminded them of the great peril in  which mankind stood , they plucked up courage , and for another day they  toiled laboriously , only to find their work obliterated next morning .  As no personal harm had befallen any of them , the wood - cutters  determined to continue their attack , but no matter how patiently they  worked during the day , the tree would be healed up in the night . They  grew more and more mystified and discouraged , and the strain of living  in that weird region was becoming intolerable . At last they decided  to return to their fellow - men , preferring to endure the foreseen doom  of the shadowed world rather than face the unknown and mysterious  terrors of the land of the Iei Tree .  As they sat , gloomy and disconsolate , brooding on their defeat ,  a little grey bird -- Ka Phreit , the Khasi wren -- came , chirruping  and twittering , close to the wood - cutters , and she began to talk  to them , urging them to keep up their courage , as she had come to  help them . Now , in spite of their spiritless condition , the woodsmen  could not help laughing to hear Ka Phreit -- the smallest of all the  birds -- so impudently offering to help them -- the picked wood - cutters of  the world -- to cut down a tree . But when the wren saw them laughing ,  she chirruped and twittered still louder , and drew still nearer ,  and with great excitement she said , "" No doubt you are great and wise ,  for you have been chosen for a great task . You are unable to perform  it , yet when I come to offer assistance , you laugh at me . It is true  that I am the smallest of all the birds , but that has not hindered me  from learning the secrets of this forest , which you must also learn  before you can cut down the Iei Tree . ""  On hearing the sage words of the wren , the woodmen felt ashamed for  having laughed at her , seeing that she meant nothing but goodwill  towards them ; so they got up and saluted her , and begged her  pardon , and asked her to teach them the secret of the forest . Thus  mollified , Ka Phreit informed them that the tree was not healed by  any supernatural agency as they had supposed

"	""" It is time , "" said the old man , "" surely . ""  And so they came at last to London 's edge and a small hill watching it  with a mournful look . It was so mean that the acolyte longed for the  cavern , dank though it was and full of terrible sayings that the old  man said when he slept .  They climbed the hill and put the cauldron down , and put there in the  necessary things , and lit a fire of herbs that no chemist will sell  nor decent gardener grow , and stirred the cauldron with the golden  poker . The magician retired a little apart and muttered , then he  strode back to the cauldron and , all being ready , suddenly opened the  casket and let the fleshy thing fall in to boil .  Then he made spells , then he flung up his arms ; the fumes from the  cauldron entering in at his mind he said raging things that he had not  known before and runes that were dreadful ( the acolyte screamed ) ;  there he cursed London from fog to loam - pit , from zenith to the abyss ,  motor - bus , factory , shop , parliament , people .

"<fairy> ”  My friend was an enthusiastic musician , being himself not only a very  capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit .
"	"All the  afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness ,  gently waving his long , thin fingers in time to the music , while his  gently smiling face and his languid , dreamy eyes were as unlike those  of Holmes the sleuth - hound , Holmes the relentless , keen - witted ,  ready - handed criminal agent , as it was possible to conceive . In his  singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself , and his  extreme exactness and astuteness represented , as I have often thought ,  the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which  occasionally predominated in him . The swing of his nature took him from  extreme languor to devouring energy ; and , as I knew well , he was never  so truly formidable as when , for days on end , he had been lounging in  his armchair amid his improvisations and his black - letter editions .  Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him ,  and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of  intuition , until those who were unacquainted with his methods would  look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other  mortals . When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St.  James ’s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom  he had set himself to hunt down .  “ You want to go home , no doubt , Doctor , ” he remarked as we emerged .  “ Yes , it would be as well . ”  “ And I have some business to do which will take some hours . This  business at Coburg Square is serious . ”  “ Why serious ? ”  “ A considerable crime is in contemplation . I have every reason to  believe that we shall be in time to stop it . But to - day being Saturday  rather complicates matters .

And , I say , Doctor , there may be some little danger , so  kindly put your army revolver in your pocket . ” He waved his hand ,  turned on his heel , and disappeared in an instant among the crowd .  I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours , but I was always  oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock  Holmes . Here I had heard what he

Then the king let him anon be christened , and did do call him  his first name Priamus , and made him a duke and knight of the Table  Round . And then anon the king let do cry assault to the city , and there  was rearing of ladders , breaking of walls , and the ditch filled , that  men with little pain might enter into the city . Then came out a  duchess , and Clarisin the countess , with many ladies and damosels , and  kneeling before King Arthur , required him for the love of God to  receive the city , and not to take it by assault , for then should many  guiltless be slain . Then the king avaled his visor with a meek and  noble countenance , and said , Madam , there shall none of my subjects  misdo you nor your maidens , nor to none that to you belong , but the  duke shall abide my judgment . Then anon the king commanded to leave the  assault , and anon the duke ’s oldest son brought out the keys , and  kneeling delivered them to the king , and besought him of grace ; and the  king seized the town by assent of his lords , and took the duke and sent  him to Dover , there for to abide prisoner term of his life , and  assigned certain rents for the dower of the duchess and for her  children .

These lighted up the whole salon , and shone through the walls  so that the sea was also illuminated . Innumerable fishes , great and  small , swam past the crystal walls ; on some of them the scales glowed  with a purple brilliance , and on others shone like silver and gold .

He had never known his wife to relent on any  occasion after she had affirmed her intention , supplemented with "" as  sure as my name is Hannah Brown . "" It was her way of swearing . No  affidavit would have had half the claim upon her as that simple  enunciation .  So back to town went Elder Brown , not in the order of the early morn ,  but silently , moodily , despairingly , surrounded by mental and actual  gloom .  The old man had turned a last appealing glance upon the angry woman ,  as he mounted with Aleck 's assistance , and sat in the light that  streamed from out the kitchen window . She met the glance without a  waver .  "" She means it , as sure as my name is Elder Brown , "" he said , thickly .  Then he rode on .

Though heavy and feverish , with a pain in her limbs , and a  cough , and a sore throat , a good night ’s rest was to cure her entirely ;  and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her , when she went  to bed , to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies .  CHAPTER XLIII .  Marianne got up the next morning at her usual time ; to every inquiry  replied that she was better , and tried to prove herself so , by engaging  in her accustomary employments . But a day spent in sitting shivering  over the fire with a book in her hand , which she was unable to read , or  in lying , weary and languid , on a sofa , did not speak much in favour of  her amendment ; and when , at last , she went early to bed , more and more  indisposed , Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her sister ’s  composure , who , though attending and nursing her the whole day , against  Marianne ’s inclination , and forcing proper medicines on her at night ,  trusted , like Marianne , to the certainty and efficacy of sleep , and  felt no real alarm .  A very restless and feverish night , however , disappointed the  expectation of both ; and when Marianne , after persisting in rising ,  confessed herself unable to sit up , and returned voluntarily to her  bed , Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings ’s advice , of sending  for the Palmers ’ apothecary .  He came , examined his patient , and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to  expect that a very few days would restore her sister to health , yet , by  pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency , and allowing the  word “ infection ” to pass his lips , gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer ,  on her baby ’s account . Mrs. Jennings , who had been inclined from the  first to think Marianne ’s complaint more serious than Elinor , now  looked very grave on Mr. Harris ’s report , and confirming Charlotte ’s  fears and caution , urged the necessity of her immediate removal with  her infant ; and Mr. Palmer , though treating their apprehensions as  idle , found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be  withstood . Her departure , therefore , was fixed on ; and within an hour  after Mr. Harris ’s arrival , she set off , with her little boy and his  nurse , for the house of a near relation of Mr.

Keeping that warning carefully in mind , Margaret got safely down stairs  and sailed into the drawing rooms where the Moffats and a few early  guests were assembled . She very soon discovered that there is a charm  about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people and secures  their respect . Several young ladies , who had taken no notice of her  before , were very affectionate all of a sudden . Several young  gentlemen , who had only stared at her at the other party , now not only  stared , but asked to be introduced , and said all manner of foolish but  agreeable things to her , and several old ladies , who sat on the sofas ,  and criticized the rest of the party , inquired who she was with an air  of interest . She heard Mrs. Moffat reply to one of them ...  “ Daisy March — father a colonel in the army — one of our first families ,  but reverses of fortune , you know ; intimate friends of the Laurences ;  sweet creature , I assure you ; my Ned is quite wild about her . ”  “ Dear me ! ” said the old lady , putting up her glass for another  observation of Meg , who tried to look as if she had not heard and been  rather shocked at Mrs. Moffat ’s fibs . The ‘ queer feeling ’ did not pass  away , but she imagined herself acting the new part of fine lady and so  got on pretty well , though the tight dress gave her a side - ache , the  train kept getting under her feet , and she was in constant fear lest  her earrings should fly off and get lost or broken . She was flirting  her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman who tried  to be witty , when she suddenly stopped laughing and looked confused ,  for just opposite , she saw Laurie . He was staring at her with  undisguised surprise , and disapproval also , she thought , for though he  bowed and smiled , yet something in his honest eyes made her blush and  wish she had her old dress on . To complete her confusion , she saw Belle  nudge Annie

As to Hallblithe , though he wondered much what all this  betokened , and what the land was whereto he was wending , he was no man to  fear an unboded peril ; and he said to himself that whatever else betid ,  he should meet the Hostage on the Glittering Plain ; so his heart rose and  he was of good cheer , and as the Grandfather had foretold , he was a merry  faring - fellow to him .   Many a gibe the old man cast at him , and whiles  Hallblithe gave him back as good as he took , and whiles he laughed as the  stroke went home and silenced him ; and whiles he understood nought of  what the elder said .   So wore the day and still the wind held fair ,  though it was light ; and the sun set in a sky nigh cloudless , and there  was nowhere any forecast of peril .   But when night was come , Hallblithe  lay down on a fair bed , which was dight for him in the poop , and he soon  fell asleep and dreamed not save such dreams as are but made up of bygone  memories , and betoken nought , and are not remembered .  When he awoke , day lay broad on the sea , and the waves were little , the  sky had but few clouds , the sun shone bright , and the air was warm and  sweet - breathed .  He looked aside and saw the old man sitting up in his bed , as ghastly as  a dead man dug up again : his bushy eyebrows were wrinkled over his  bleared old eyes , the long white hair dangled forlorn from his gaunt  head : yet was his face smiling and he looked as happy as the soul within  him could make the half - dead body .   He turned now to Hallblithe and said :  "" Thou art late awake : hadst thou been waking earlier , the sooner had  thine heart been gladdened .   Go forward now , and gaze thy fill and come  and tell me thereof . ""  "" Thou art happy , Grandfather , "" said Hallblithe , "" what good tidings hath  morn brought us ? ""  "" The Land ! the Land ! "" said the Long - hoary ; "" there are no longer tears in  this old body , else

"<fantasy> So she got together all the jewelry  she possessed and placing it in her handbag started for the town .
"	" She had an idea that a jewelry shop was the proper place to sell her  jewelry , but Mr. Trumbull the jeweler shook his head and said that  Watson , at the bank , often loaned money on such security . He advised  the girl to see Watson .  So Mary Louise went to the "" bank , "" which was a one - man affair situated  in the rear of the hardware store , where a grating had been placed in  one corner . There she found Mr. Watson , who was more a country broker  than a banker , and throve by lending money to farmers .  Gran'pa Jim was almost as fond of pretty jewels as he was of good  clothes and he had always been generous in presenting his  grand - daughter with trinkets on her birthdays and at Christmas time .  The jewelry she laid before Mr. Watson was really valuable and the  banker 's eye was especially attracted by a brooch of pearls that must  have cost several hundred dollars .  "" How much do you want to borrow on this lot ? "" he asked .  "" As much as I can get , sir , "" she replied .  "" Have you any idea of redeeming it ? ""  "" I hope to do so , of course . ""  The banker knew perfectly well who Mary Louise was and suspected she  needed money .  "" This is no pawnbroker 's shop , "" he asserted . "" I 'll give you a hundred  dollars , outright , for this pearl brooch -- as a purchase ,  understand -- but the rest of the junk I do n't want . ""  A little man who had entered the hardware store to purchase a tin  dipper was getting so close to the "" bank "" that Mary Louise feared being  overheard ; so she did not argue with Mr. Watson . Deciding that a  hundred dollars ought to take her to Dorfield , she promptly accepted  the offer , signed a bill of sale and received her money . Then she  walked two miles to the railway station and discovered that a ticket to  Dorfield could be bought for ninety - two dollars . That would give her  eight dollars leeway , which seemed quite sufficient . Elated at the  prospect of freedom she returned to the school to make her preparation  for departure and arrived just in time to join the other girls at  dinner .  CHAPTER VII  THE ESCAPE  As she packed her trunk behind the locked door of her room -- an  unnecessary precaution , since the girls generally avoided her  society -- Mary Louise considered whether to confide the fact

"	""" It will not  help you , so you may as well be still . ""  The next morning poor Gretel was forced to light the fire and hang the  great pot of water over it , and then the witch said : "" First we will  bake . I have kneaded the dough , and heated the oven ; you shall creep  inside it to see if it is hot enough to bake the bread . ""  But Gretel guessed that the old witch meant to shut the door upon her  and roast her , so she pretended that she did not know how to get in .  "" Silly goose , "" said the witch . "" The door is wide enough , to be sure .  Why , even I could get inside it . "" As she spoke , she popped her head  into the oven . In a moment Gretel sprang towards her , pushed her  inside , shut the iron door , and shot the bolt . Oh ! how she squealed  and shrieked , but Gretel ran off as fast as she could , and so there  was an end of the cruel old witch .  Quick as thought , Gretel ran to her brother . "" We are saved , Hansel , ""  she cried , opening the door of the stable , "" the wicked old witch is  dead . ""  Hansel flew from his prison as a bird from its cage , and the two happy  little children kissed each other and jumped for joy . No longer afraid  of the old witch , they entered the house , hand in hand , and then  they saw that in every corner of the room were boxes of pearls and  diamonds , and all kinds of precious gems .  "" Ah ! "" said Hansel merrily , "" these are better than pebbles , Gretel , ""  and he stuffed his pockets with the jewels , whilst Gretel filled her  pinafore . "" Now , "" said Hansel , "" we will leave the witch 's wood behind  us as fast as we can . ""  So off they ran , and never stopped until they came to a lake , upon  which swam a large white duck .  "" How can we cross , "" said Hansel , "" for there is no bridge anywhere ? ""  "" And no ship either , "" Gretel answered ; "" but we will ask the pretty  white duck to carry us over .

What chafferers hear ye bid loud for your goods ?                         _ The Men of the Bull sing _ :     O the bright beams we carry are stems of the steel ;     Nor long shall we tarry across them to deal .     Hark the men of the cheaping , how loudly they cry     On the hook for the reaping of men doomed to die !                               _ They all sing _ :     Heave spear up ! fare forward , O Men of the Dale !     For the Warrior , our war - ward , shall hearken the tale .  Therewith they ceased a moment , and then gave a great and hearty shout  all together , and all their horns blew , and they moved on down the hill  as one man , slowly and with no jostling , the spear - men first , and then  they of the axe and the sword ; and on their flanks the deft archers  loosed on the stumbling jostling throng of the Dusky Men , who for their  part came on drifting and surging up the road to the hill .  But when those big spearmen of the Dale had gone a little way the horns ’  voice died out , and their great - staved spears rose up from their  shoulders into the air , and stood so a moment , and then slowly fell  forward , as the oars of the longship fall into the row - locks , and then  over the shoulders of the foremost men showed the steel of the five ranks  behind them , and their own spears cast long bars of shadow on the  whiteness of the sunny road .   No sound came from them now save the rattle  of their armour and the tramp of their steady feet ; but from the Dusky  Men rose up hideous confused yelling , and those that could free  themselves from the tangle of the throng rushed desperately against the  on - rolling hedge of steel , and the whole throng shoved on behind them .  Then met steel and men ; here and there an ash - stave broke ; here and there  a Dusky Felon rolled himself unhurt under the ash - staves , and hewed the  knees of the Dalesmen , and a tall man came tottering down ; but what men  or wood - wights could endure the push of spears of those mighty  husbandmen ?   The Dusky Ones shrunk back yelling , or turned their backs  and rushed at their own folk with such fierce agony that they entered  into the throng , till the terror

Lo , I hear the tumult of the men approaching . ”   “ I will do  so , gladly . ”   So she armed him fully , and that right cheerfully .   “ Hast  thou finished arming the youth ? ” said he .   “ I have finished , ” she  answered .   “ I likewise have finished , ” said Gwydion .   “ Let us now take  off our arms , we have no need of them . ”   “ Wherefore ? ” said she .   “ Here is  the army around the house . ”   “ Oh , lady , there is here no army . ”   “ Oh , ”  cried she , “ whence then was this tumult ? ”   “ The tumult was but to break  thy prophecy and to obtain arms for thy son .   And now has he got arms  without any thanks unto thee . ”   “ By Heaven , ” said Arianrod , “ thou art a  wicked man .   Many a youth might have lost his life through the uproar  thou hast caused in this Cantrev to - day .   Now will I lay a destiny upon  this youth , ” she said , “ that he shall never have a wife of the race that  now inhabits this earth . ”   “ Verily , ” said he , “ thou wast ever a malicious  woman , and no one ought to support thee .   A wife shall he have  notwithstanding . ”  They went thereupon unto Math the son of Mathonwy , and complained unto  him most bitterly of Arianrod .   Gwydion showed him also how he had  procured arms for the youth .   “ Well , ” said Math , “ we will seek , I and  thou , by charms and illusion , to form a wife for him out of flowers .   He  has now come to man ’s stature , and he is the comeliest youth that was  ever beheld . ”   So they took the blossoms of the oak , and the blossoms of  the broom , and the blossoms of the meadow - sweet , and produced from them a  maiden , the fairest and most graceful that man ever saw .   And they  baptized her , and gave her the name of Blodeuwedd .  After she had become his bride , and they had feasted , said Gwydion , “ It  is not easy for a man to maintain himself without possessions . ”

They  took them to their father , who was astonished and said , “ How can that  have happened ? ” When next morning they again found two , and so on  daily , he went to his brother and told him the strange story .
"	"The  goldsmith at once knew how it had come to pass , and that the children  had eaten the heart and liver of the golden bird , and in order to  revenge himself , and because he was envious and hard - hearted , he said  to the father , “ Thy children are in league with the Evil One , do not  take the gold , and do not suffer them to stay any longer in thy house ,  for he has them in his power , and may ruin thee likewise . ” The father  feared the Evil One , and painful as it was to him , he nevertheless led  the twins forth into the forest , and with a sad heart left them there .  And now the two children ran about the forest , and sought the way home  again , but could not find it , and only lost themselves more and more .  At length they met with a huntsman , who asked , “ To whom do you children  belong ? ” “ We are the poor broom - maker ’s boys , ” they replied , and they  told him that their father would not keep them any longer in the house  because a piece of gold lay every morning under their pillows . “ Come , ”  said the huntsman , “ that is nothing so very bad , if at the same time  you keep honest , and are not idle . ” As the good man liked the children ,  and had none of his own , he took them home with him and said , “ I will  be your father , and bring you up till you are big . ” They learnt  huntsmanship from him , and the piece of gold which each of them found  when he awoke , was kept for them by him in case they should need it in  the future .  When they were grown up , their foster - father one day took them into the  forest with him , and said , “ To - day shall you make your trial shot , so  that I may release you from your apprenticeship , and make you  huntsmen . ” They went with him to lie in wait and stayed there a long  time , but no game appeared . The huntsman , however , looked above him and  saw a covey of wild geese flying in the form of a triangle , and said to  one of them , “ Shoot me down one from each corner . ” He did it , and thus  accomplished his trial shot . Soon after another covey came flying by in  the form of the figure two , and the huntsman

And when they spied him , they thought  he was Sir Key . "" Now by my faith , "" said Sir Sagramour , "" I will prove Sir  Key 's might ! "" and taking his spear he rode towards Sir Lancelot .  But Sir Lancelot was aware of him , and , setting his spear in rest , smote  him so sorely , that horse and man fell to the earth .  "" Lo ! "" cried Sir Ector , "" I see by the buffet that knight hath given our  fellow he is stronger than Sir Key . Now will I try what I can do against  him ! "" So Sir Ector took his spear , and galloped at Sir Lancelot ; and Sir  Lancelot met him as he came , and smote him through shield and shoulder , so  that he fell , but his own spear was not broken .  "" By my faith , "" cried Sir Ewaine , "" yonder is a strong knight , and must have  slain Sir Key , and taken his armour ! By his strength , I see it will be  hard to match him . "" So saying he rode towards Sir Lancelot , who met him  halfway and struck him so fiercely , that at one blow he overthrew him  also .  "" Now , "" said Sir Gawain , "" will I encounter him . "" So he took a good spear in  his hand , and guarded himself with his shield . And he and Sir Lancelot  rode against each other , with their horses at full speed , and furiously  smote each other on the middle of their shields ; but Sir Gawain 's spear  broke short asunder , and Sir Lancelot charged so mightily upon him , that  his horse and he both fell , and rolled upon the ground .  "" Ah , "" said Sir Lancelot , smiling , as he rode away from the four knights ,  "" heaven give joy to him who made this spear , for never held I better in my  hand .

"	"But I must turn to something else and resume my  subject , and you shall hear how the king speaks profitably to his son :  "" Son , "" he says , "" it was fortunate that thou and I came to look out  this window ; our reward has been to witness the boldest deed that ever  entered the mind of man . Tell me now if thou art not well disposed  toward him who has performed such a marvellous feat . Make peace and be  reconciled with him , and deliver the Queen into his hands . Thou shalt  gain no glory in battle with him , but rather mayst thou incur great  loss . Show thyself to be courteous and sensible , and send the Queen to  meet him before he sees thee . Show him honour in this land of thine , and  before he asks it , present to him what he has come to seek . Thou knowest  well enough that he has come for the Queen Guinevere . Do not act so that  people will take thee to be obstinate , foolish , or proud . If this man  has entered thy land alone , thou shouldst bear him company , for one  gentleman ought not to avoid another , but rather attract him and honour  him with courtesy . One receives honour by himself showing it ; be sure  that the honour will be thine , if thou doest honour and service to him  who is plainly the best knight in the world . "" And he replies : "" May God  confound me , if there is not as good a knight , or even a better one  than he ! "" It was too bad that he did not mention himself , of whom he  entertains no mean opinion . And he adds : "" I suppose you wish me to clasp  my hands and kneel before him as his liegeman , and to hold my lands from  him ? So help me God , I would rather become his man than surrender to  him the Queen ! God forbid that in such a fashion I should deliver her  to him ! She shall never be given up by me , but rather contested and  defended against all who are so foolish as to dare to come in quest  of her . "" Then again the king says to him : "" Son , thou wouldst act very  courteously to renounce this pretension . I advise thee and beg thee to  keep the peace . Thou knowest well that the honour will belong to the  knight , if he wins the Queen from thee in battle . He would doubtless  rather win her in battle than as a gift ,

"	"You must not open this  box , whatever happens ! If you open it something dreadful will happen to  you ! Now promise me that you will never open this box ! ”  And Urashima promised that he would never , never open the box whatever  happened .  Then bidding good - by to Otohime Sama he went down to the seashore , the  Princess and her attendants following him , and there he found a large  tortoise waiting for him .  He quickly mounted the creature ’s back and was carried away over the  shining sea into the East . He looked back to wave his hand to Otohime  Sama till at last he could see her no more , and the land of the Sea  King and the roofs of the wonderful palace were lost in the far , far  distance . Then , with his face turned eagerly towards his own land , he  looked for the rising of the blue hills on the horizon before him .  At last the tortoise carried him into the bay he knew so well , and to  the shore from whence he had set out . He stepped on to the shore and  looked about him while the tortoise rode away back to the Sea King ’s  realm .  But what is the strange fear that seizes Urashima as he stands and  looks about him ? Why does he gaze so fixedly at the people that pass  him by , and why do they in turn stand and look at him ? The shore is the  same and the hills are the same , but the people that he sees walking  past him have very different faces to those he had known so well  before .  Wondering what it can mean he walks quickly towards his old home . Even  that looks different , but a house stands on the spot , and he calls out :  “ Father , I have just returned ! ” and he was about to enter , when he saw  a strange man coming out .  “ Perhaps my parents have moved while I have been away , and have gone  somewhere else , ” was the fisherman ’s thought . Somehow he began to feel  strangely anxious , he could not tell why .  “ Excuse me , ” said he to the man who was staring at him , “ but till  within the last few days I have lived in this house . My name is  Urashima Taro . Where have my parents gone whom I left here ? ”  A very bewildered expression came over the face of the man , and , still  gazing intently on Urashima ’s face , he said :

But you ’ll admit what a riddle it must have been for us when  that calm , cold , little spitfire , Aglaya—(for she stood up to her  mother and answered her questions with inexpressible contempt , and mine  still more so , because , like a fool , I thought it my duty to assert  myself as head of the family)—when Aglaya stood up of a sudden and  informed us that ‘ that madwoman ’ ( strangely enough , she used exactly  the same expression as you did ) ‘ has taken it into her head to marry me  to Prince Lef Nicolaievitch , and therefore is doing her best to choke  Evgenie Pavlovitch off , and rid the house of him . ’ That ’s what she  said .

In the course of a great many journeys  to the forest he carried away many rich stuffs and much fine linen , and  set up a shop opposite that of Ali Baba ’s son . He called himself Cogia  Hassan , and as he was both civil and well dressed he soon made friends  with Ali Baba ’s son , and through him with Ali Baba , whom he was  continually asking to sup with him . Ali Baba , wishing to return his  kindness , invited him into his house and received him smiling , thanking  him for his kindness to his son . When the merchant was about to take his  leave Ali Baba stopped him , saying : “ Where are you going , sir , in such  haste ? Will you not stay and sup with me ? ” The merchant refused , saying  that he had a reason ; and , on Ali Baba ’s asking him what that was , he  replied : “ It is , sir , that I can eat no victuals that have any salt  in them . ” “ If that is all , ” said Ali Baba , “ let me tell you that there  shall be no salt in either the meat or the bread that we eat to - night . ”   He went to give this order to Morgiana , who was much surprised . “ Who is  this man , ” she said , “ who eats no salt with his meat ? ” “ He is an honest  man , Morgiana , ” returned her master ; “ therefore do as I bid you . ” But  she could not withstand a desire to see this strange man , so she helped  Abdallah to carry up the dishes , and saw in a moment that Cogia Hassan  was the robber Captain , and carried a dagger under his garment . “ I am  not surprised , ” she said to herself , “ that this wicked man , who intends  to kill my master , will eat no salt with him ; but I will hinder his  plans . ”  She sent up the supper by Abdallah , while she made ready for one of the  boldest acts that could be thought on . When the dessert had been served ,  Cogia Hassan was left alone with Ali Baba and his son , whom he thought  to make drunk and then to murder them .

So they asked the cow that question , but it only smiled and said  nothing .  “ If a cow talked to you , ” said Brigid , “ what would it say ? ”  “ Let us be cows , ” replied Seumas , “ and then , maybe , we will find out . ”  So they became cows and ate a few blades of grass , but they found that  when they were cows they did not want to say anything but “ moo , ” and  they decided that cows did not want to say anything more than that  either , and they became interested in the reflection that , perhaps ,  nothing else was worth saying .  A long , thin , yellow - coloured fly was going in that direction on a  journey , and he stopped to rest himself on the cow ’s nose .  “ You are welcome , ” said the cow .  “ It ’s a great night for travelling , ” said the fly , “ but one gets tired  alone .

That is the more pity , said Dinadan , for Sir  Gawaine and his brethren , except you Sir Gareth , hate all the good  knights of the Round Table for the most part ; for well I wot an they  might privily , they hate my lord Sir Launcelot and all his kin , and  great privy despite they have at him ; and that is my lord Sir Launcelot  well ware of , and that causeth him to have the good knights of his kin  about him .

Sir , said Palomides , let us leave of this matter , and let us see how we  shall do at this tournament . By mine advice , said Palomides , let us  four hold together against all that will come . Not by my counsel , said  Sir Tristram , for I see by their pavilions there will be four hundred  knights , and doubt ye not , said Sir Tristram , but there will be many  good knights ; and be a man never so valiant nor so big , yet he may be  overmatched . And so have I seen knights done many times ; and when they  weened best to have won worship they lost it , for manhood is not worth  but if it be medled with wisdom . And as for me , said Sir Tristram , it  may happen I shall keep mine own head as well as another .  So thus they rode until that they came to Humber bank , where they heard  a cry and a doleful noise . Then were they ware in the wind where came a  rich vessel hilled over with red silk , and the vessel landed fast by  them . Therewith Sir Tristram alighted and his knights . And so Sir  Tristram went afore and entered into that vessel . And when he came  within he saw a fair bed richly covered , and thereupon lay a dead  seemly knight , all armed save the head , was all be - bled with deadly  wounds upon him , the which seemed to be a passing good knight . How may  this be , said Sir Tristram , that this knight is thus slain ? Then Sir  Tristram was ware of a letter in the dead knight ’s hand .

"<fairy>  Then , sitting in Beth ’s little chair close beside him , Jo told her  troubles , the resentful sorrow for her loss , the fruitless efforts that  discouraged her , the want of faith that made life look so dark , and all  the sad bewilderment which we call despair .
"	"She gave him entire  confidence , he gave her the help she needed , and both found consolation  in the act . For the time had come when they could talk together not  only as father and daughter , but as man and woman , able and glad to  serve each other with mutual sympathy as well as mutual love . Happy ,  thoughtful times there in the old study which Jo called ‘ the church of  one member ’ , and from which she came with fresh courage , recovered  cheerfulness , and a more submissive spirit . For the parents who had  taught one child to meet death without fear , were trying now to teach  another to accept life without despondency or distrust , and to use its  beautiful opportunities with gratitude and power .  Other helps had Jo — humble , wholesome duties and delights that would not  be denied their part in serving her , and which she slowly learned to  see and value . Brooms and dishcloths never could be as distasteful as  they once had been , for Beth had presided over both , and something of  her housewifely spirit seemed to linger around the little mop and the  old brush , never thrown away . As she used them , Jo found herself  humming the songs Beth used to hum , imitating Beth ’s orderly ways , and  giving the little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and  cozy , which was the first step toward making home happy , though she  did n’t know it till Hannah said with an approving squeeze of the  hand ...  “ You thoughtful creeter , you ’re determined we sha n’t miss that dear  lamb ef you can help it . We do n’t say much , but we see it , and the Lord  will bless you for’t , see ef He do n’t . ”  As they sat sewing together , Jo discovered how much improved her sister  Meg was , how well she could talk , how much she knew about good , womanly  impulses , thoughts , and feelings , how happy she was in husband and  children , and how much they were all doing for each other .  “ Marriage is an excellent thing , after all . I wonder if I should  blossom out half as well as you have , if I tried it ? , always  _ ‘ perwisin ’ _ I could , ” said Jo , as she constructed a kite for Demi in  the topsy - turvy nursery .  “ It ’s just what you need to bring out the tender womanly half of your  nature , Jo . You are like a chestnut burr , prickly

"<fantasy> And as he rode in a forest  there met with him two knights adventurous , the one was Breuse Saunce  Pité , and his brother , Sir Bertelot ; and these two ran both at once  upon Sir Bliant , and brake their spears upon his body .
"	"And then they  drew out swords and made great battle , and fought long together . But at  the last Sir Bliant was sore wounded , and felt himself faint ; and then  he fled on horseback toward his castle . And as they came hurling under  the castle whereas Sir Launcelot lay in a window , [ he ] saw how two  knights laid upon Sir Bliant with their swords . And when Sir Launcelot  saw that , yet as wood as he was he was sorry for his lord , Sir Bliant .  And then Sir Launcelot brake the chains from his legs and off his arms ,  and in the breaking he hurt his hands sore ; and so Sir Launcelot ran  out at a postern , and there he met with the two knights that chased Sir  Bliant ; and there he pulled down Sir Bertelot with his bare hands from  his horse , and therewithal he wrothe his sword out of his hand ; and so  he leapt unto Sir Breuse , and gave him such a buffet upon the head that  he tumbled backward over his horse ’s croup . And when Sir Bertelot saw  there his brother have such a fall , he gat a spear in his hand , and  would have run Sir Launcelot through : that saw Sir Bliant , and struck  off the hand of Sir Bertelot . And then Sir Breuse and Sir Bertelot gat  their horses and fled away .  When Sir Selivant came and saw what Sir Launcelot had done for his  brother , then he thanked God , and so did his brother , that ever they  did him any good . But when Sir Bliant saw that Sir Launcelot was hurt  with the breaking of his irons , then was he heavy that ever he bound  him . Bind him no more , said Sir Selivant , for he is happy and gracious .  Then they made great joy of Sir Launcelot , and they bound him no more ;  and so he abode there an half year and more . And on the morn early Sir  Launcelot was ware where came a great boar with many hounds nigh him .  But the boar was so big there might no hounds tear him ; and the hunters  came after , blowing their horns , both upon horseback and some upon  foot ; and then Sir Launcelot was ware where one alighted and tied his  horse to a tree , and leaned his spear against the tree .

"	"She saw the  bright sun , and hundreds of transparent , beautiful creatures floating  around her -- she could see through them the white sails of the ships and  the red clouds in the sky . Their speech was melodious , but could not be  heard by mortal ears -- just as their bodies could not be seen by mortal  eyes . The little mermaid perceived that she had a body like theirs and  that she continued to rise higher and higher out of the foam . "" Where am  I ? "" asked she , and her voice sounded ethereal , like the voices of those  who were with her . No earthly music could imitate it .  "" Among the daughters of the air , "" answered one of them . "" A mermaid has  not an immortal soul , nor can she obtain one unless she wins the love of  a human being . On the will of another hangs her eternal destiny . But the  daughters of the air , although they do not possess an immortal soul ,  can , by their good deeds , procure one for themselves . We fly to warm  countries and cool the sultry air that destroys mankind with the  pestilence . We carry the perfume of the flowers to spread health and  restoration .

""  The little mermaid lifted her glorified eyes toward the sun and , for the  first time , felt them filling with tears .  On the ship in which she had left the prince there were life and noise ,  and she saw him and his beautiful bride searching for her . Sorrowfully  they gazed at the pearly foam , as if they knew she had thrown herself  into the waves . Unseen she kissed the forehead of the bride and fanned  the prince , and then mounted with the other children of the air to a  rosy cloud that floated above .

When he  should become a man , he would be -- well , he was not certain whether he  would be like unto the King , Sir Percival or Sir Launcelot . Yes , he  did know , he would be like them all . Now there came mixed thoughts of  a maid who waved her hand and smiled at him . And he felt of a  precious ring upon his finger .  So now his eyes closed ; he found himself seeking the Holy Grail .

It had reached Leek , in Stafford on the morn of the fifth day ere word  came of Sir Tristram . Here , was heard from some , Sir Tristram was then  on way to Scotland , and from still others , that he was bound for  Kinkenadon in Wales .

Yet still ,  have I many doubts as to his being both on way to Scotland and to  Wales as well . ""  "" If it were left to me , "" said Sir Dagonet , "" I would hie me to Ireland .

At last they came to a great wide plain , where , far or near , nothing was  to be seen but bare sand , without so much as a pebble or a single blade  of grass , and there night caught up with them .  “ Dear , dear , but I am hungry ! ” said Babo .  “ So am I , ” said Simon Agricola . “ Let ’s sit down here and eat . ”  So down they sat , and Simon Agricola opened his pouch and drew forth the  stone .  The stone ? It was a stone no longer , but a fine loaf of white bread as  big as your two fists . You should have seen Babo goggle and stare ! “ Give  me a piece of your bread , master , ” said he .  “ Not I , ” said Agricola . “ You might have had a dozen of the same kind ,  had you chosen to do as I bade you and to fetch them along with you .

The next morning off they started again bright and early , and before  long they came to just such another field of stones as they left behind  them the day before .  “ Come , master , ” said Babo , “ let us each take a stone with us . We may  need something more to eat before the day is over . ”  “ No , ” said Simon Agricola ; “ we will need no stones to - day . ”  But Babo had no notion to go hungry the second time , so he hunted around  till he found a stone as big as his head .

So  it was not very pleasant when she opened the door of her room , to see  Martha standing waiting for her with a doleful face .  “ What is the matter ? ” she asked . “ What did Colin say when you told him  I could n’t come ? ”  “ Eh ! ” said Martha , “ I wish tha’d gone . He was nigh goin’ into one o ’  his tantrums . There ’s been a nice to do all afternoon to keep him  quiet . He would watch the clock all th ’ time . ”  Mary ’s lips pinched themselves together . She was no more used to  considering other people than Colin was and she saw no reason why an  ill - tempered boy should interfere with the thing she liked best . She  knew nothing about the pitifulness of people who had been ill and  nervous and who did not know that they could control their tempers and  need not make other people ill and nervous , too . When she had had a  headache in India she had done her best to see that everybody else also  had a headache or something quite as bad . And she felt she was quite  right ; but of course now she felt that Colin was quite wrong .  He was not on his sofa when she went into his room . He was lying flat  on his back in bed and he did not turn his head toward her as she came  in . This was a bad beginning and Mary marched up to him with her stiff  manner .  “ Why did n’t you get up ? ” she said .  “ I did get up this morning when I thought you were coming , ” he  answered , without looking at her . “ I made them put me back in bed this  afternoon . My back ached and my head ached and I was tired . Why did n’t  you come ? ”  “ I was working in the garden with Dickon , ” said Mary .  Colin frowned and condescended to look at her .  “ I wo n’t let that boy come here if you go and stay with him instead of  coming to talk to me , ” he said .  Mary flew into a fine passion .

"	"I know , Doctor Manette -- how can I fail to know -- that , mingled  with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman , there  is , in her heart , towards you , all the love and reliance of infancy  itself . I know that , as in her childhood she had no parent , so she is  now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present  years and character , united to the trustfulness and attachment of the  early days in which you were lost to her . I know perfectly well that if  you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life , you could  hardly be invested , in her sight , with a more sacred character than that  in which you are always with her . I know that when she is clinging to  you , the hands of baby , girl , and woman , all in one , are round your  neck . I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her  own age , sees and loves you at my age , loves her mother broken - hearted ,  loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration . I  have known this , night and day , since I have known you in your home . ”  Her father sat silent , with his face bent down . His breathing was a  little quickened ; but he repressed all other signs of agitation .  “ Dear Doctor Manette , always knowing this , always seeing her and you  with this hallowed light about you , I have forborne , and forborne , as  long as it was in the nature of man to do it .

"	"They gave him a quiet room , because they deemed that he  was sick ; but their good nature was put to a test when they allowed the  lion to go with him . His cure was undertaken by two maidens skilled in  surgery , who were daughters of the lord . I do not know how many days  he stayed there , until he and his lion , being cured , were compelled to  proceed upon their way .  ( Vv . 4703 - 4736 . ) But within this time it came about that my lord of  Noire Espine had a struggle with Death , and so fierce was Death 's attack  that he was forced to die . After his death it happened that the elder of  two daughters whom he had , announced that she would possess uncontested  all the estates for herself during her entire lifetime , and that she  would give no share to her sister . And the other one said that she would  go to King Arthur 's court to seek help for the defence of her claim to  the land . When the former saw that her sister would by no means concede  all the estates to her without contest , she was greatly concerned , and  thought that , if possible , she would get to court before her . At once  she prepared and equipped herself , and without any tarrying or delay ,  she proceeded to the court . The other followed her , and made all the  haste she could ; but her journey was all in vain , for her eider sister  had already presented her case to my lord Gawain , and he had promised  to execute her will . But there was an agreement between them that if any  one should learn of the facts from her , he would never again take arms  for her , and to this arrangement she gave consent .  ( Vv . 4737 - 4758 . ) Just then the other sister arrived at court , clad in  a short mantle of scarlet cloth and fresh ermine . It happened to be  the third day after the Queen had returned from the captivity in which  Maleagant had detained her with all the other prisoners ; but Lancelot  had remained behind , treacherously confined within a tower . And on that  very day , when the damsel came to court , news was received of the cruel  and wicked giant whom the knight with the lion had killed in battle . In  his name , my lord Gawain was greeted by his nephews and niece , who told  him in detail of all the great service and great deeds of prowess he  had done for them for

"	"When a word is missed , the blunderer has to sit down , and  be a spectator only for the rest of the evening . At certain intervals ,  some of the best speakers mount the platform , and "" speak a piece , ""  which is generally as declamatory as possible .  The excitement of this scene is equal to that afforded by any city  spectacle whatever ; and towards the close of the evening , when  difficult and unusual words are chosen to confound the small number  who still keep the floor , it becomes scarcely less than painful . When  perhaps only one or two remain to be puzzled , the master , weary at  last of his task , though a favorite one , tries by tricks to put down  those whom he can not overcome in fair fight . If among all the curious ,  useless , unheard - of words which may be picked out of the  spelling - book , he can not find one which the scholars have not noticed ,  he gets the last head down by some quip or catch . "" Bay "" will perhaps  be the sound ; one scholar spells it "" bey , "" another , "" bay , "" while the  master all the time means "" ba , "" which comes within the rule , being _ in  the spelling - book _ .  It was on one of these occasions , as we have said , that Miss Bangle ,  having come to the spelling - school to get materials for a letter to a  female friend , first shone upon Mr. Horner . She was excessively amused  by his solemn air and puckered mouth , and set him down at once as fair  game . Yet she could not help becoming somewhat interested in the  spelling - school , and after it was over found she had not stored up  half as many of the schoolmaster 's points as she intended , for the  benefit of her correspondent .  In the evening 's contest a young girl from some few miles ' distance ,  Ellen Kingsbury , the only child of a substantial farmer , had been the  very last to sit down , after a prolonged effort on the part of Mr.  Horner to puzzle her , for the credit of his own school . She blushed ,  and smiled , and blushed again , but spelt on , until Mr. Horner 's cheeks  were crimson with excitement and some touch of shame that he should be  baffled at his own weapons . At length , either by accident or design ,  Ellen missed a word , and sinking into her seat was numbered with the  slain .

A universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the  wreck and a golden head emerged , exclaiming , “ I told you so ! I told you  so ! ” With wonderful presence of mind , Don Pedro , the cruel sire , rushed  in , dragged out his daughter , with a hasty aside ...  “ Do n’t laugh ! Act as if it was all right ! ” and , ordering Roderigo up ,  banished him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn . Though decidedly  shaken by the fall from the tower upon him , Roderigo defied the old  gentleman and refused to stir . This dauntless example fired Zara . She  also defied her sire , and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons  of the castle . A stout little retainer came in with chains and led them  away , looking very much frightened and evidently forgetting the speech  he ought to have made .  Act third was the castle hall , and here Hagar appeared , having come to  free the lovers and finish Hugo . She hears him coming and hides , sees  him put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the timid little  servant , “ Bear them to the captives in their cells , and tell them I  shall come anon . ” The servant takes Hugo aside to tell him something ,  and Hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless .  Ferdinando , the ‘ minion ’ , carries them away , and Hagar puts back the  cup which holds the poison meant for Roderigo . Hugo , getting thirsty  after a long warble , drinks it , loses his wits , and after a good deal  of clutching and stamping , falls flat and dies , while Hagar informs him  what she has done in a song of exquisite power and melody .  This was a truly thrilling scene , though some persons might have  thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long red hair  rather marred the effect of the villain ’s death . He was called before  the curtain , and with great propriety appeared , leading Hagar , whose  singing was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the  performance put together .  Act fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of stabbing  himself because he has been told that Zara has deserted him . Just as  the dagger is at his heart , a lovely song is sung under his window ,  informing him that Zara is true

At that time was a new lawman made , Stein , the son of Thorgest , the  son of Stein the Far - sailing , the son of Thorir Autumn - mirk ; the  mother of Stein was Arnora , the daughter of Thord the Yeller ; and  Stein was a wise man .  Now was he prayed for the word of decision ; and he bade them search  and see whether this were the twentieth summer since Grettir was made  an outlaw , and thus it seemed to be .  But then stood forth Thorir of Garth , and brought all into dispute  again , for he found that Grettir had been one winter out here a  sackless man , amidst the times of his outlawry , and then nineteen were  the winters of his outlawry found to be . Then said the lawman that no  one should be longer in outlawry than twenty winters in all , though he  had done outlaw 's deeds in that time .  "" But before that , I declare no man sackless .

And sudden , it made pause , and did begin that it brought all the mighty  body together , and humpt itself , and brought the head - part round unto  the bottom of the cliff that made this side of the Gorge . And it  gathered itself , and afterward did lengthen upward against the cliff ,  and begin to climb . And lo ! I saw that the Beast did scent of us , and  made to come upward to destroy us .  And as the mighty hill of the body did come into length against the  great cliff - side , the Beast set the eye - stalks into this cave and that ,  as it did go , and into all crannies ; and so lengthened upward very  straight and monstrous and dreadful unto us , and did be as a white and  mildewed hill , that had an horrid life . And the stink to come up , so  that we did be like to lose our breath with the dreadfulness of it , as  you shall think .  And surely , for a moment , I looked unto the rocks upon the ledge , and  this way and that way , and upward unto the everlasting darkness that did  be above us , and again unto the great rock that did seem to quiver upon  the edge , as I have told . And I was grown utter desperate in a moment ;  for , truly , it did seem in that instant that there did be no power in  the world that should slay so utter mighty a Monster .  And immediately , even as I did despair , I had run very swift unto the  great rock , and the Maid with me , both very strained and shaken with the  horror of the thing that did make upward unto us so sure and intent .  And I set my strength unto the rock , and heaved ; but indeed the rock  gave not from the place where it did be ; so that I had a dreadful  despair ; for I saw that it did be more secure than had seemed . And the  Maid lent her strength unto mine , and we heaved together , with sore  pantings , and little cries to guide our endeavours and because we could  not be contained in that moment .  And surely it seemed that the great rock moved , and lo ! as we strove  together to the task , there came a vast and sudden grinding , and the  rock to cease from our shoulders , and to be gone from us ,

"	" Birdalone ’s heart yearned toward them , and she stepped straightway from  out of the cover of the coppice , and the sun flamed from her sallet and  glittered in the rings of her hauberk , so that the folk might not fail to  see her ; the sheep fled bundling from her past their keepers , who stood  firm , but seemed somewhat scared , and moved not toward Birdalone .   She  gave them the sele of the day and stood still herself ; but the man with  the ash - wand said : Hail , thou man ; but we would have thee come no nearer  a while , though thy voice be sweet : for we know what things they be which  thou bearest , and that thou art a warrior .   Wilt thou hurt us ?  Birdalone laughed as sweetly as the blackbird sings , and she did off her  sallet and shook the plenteous hair down over her , and then drew forth  her sword and dagger and cast them to earth , and laid her bow and quiver  of arrows upon them , and said : Now will I come to you , or ye shall come  to me , whereas I am unweaponed , and no warrior , but a woman , and ye are  four to one , and two of you carles ; wherefore now ye may bind me or slay  me if you will ; but in any case I pray you first to give me a mouthful of  meat .  When she had done her speech , she went up to the fairest of the women and  kissed her ; but the two carles made no more ado but came to Birdalone and  kissed her one after other , and that as men who needed nought to compel  them therein , and each thereafter took a hand of her and held it and  caressed it .   But the other woman had run into the house as soon as  Birdalone spoke , and came back again with a treen bowl full of milk and a  little loaf , not white but brown ; and there blundered about her legs as  she came a little lad of some three winters old , naked and brown , who was  shy of the gleaming new - comer , and hid him behind the woman one while ,  and the other while came forth to see the new thing .   But the woman said :  Dear woman , here is for thee some of the ewes ’ milk , and a bite of bread ,  and a little deal of cheese ; the said milk is yet warm , so that it is not  yet clottered ; but if thou

"	" “ Yes’m . ” was the meek answer , as he began , doing his best to prove his  gratitude for the favor of admission into the ‘ Busy Bee Society ’ .  The story was not a long one , and when it was finished , he ventured to  ask a few questions as a reward of merit .  “ Please , ma’am , could I inquire if this highly instructive and charming  institution is a new one ? ”  “ Would you tell him ? ” asked Meg of her sisters .  “ He ’ll laugh , ” said Amy warningly .  “ Who cares ? ” said Jo .  “ I guess he ’ll like it , ” added Beth .  “ Of course I shall !

I wanted to amuse him one night when you were all away , and  he was rather dismal . He did like it , so do n’t scold , Jo , ” said Beth  meekly .  “ You ca n’t keep a secret .

"	"As he stepped up to  the cab , he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it  earnestly , ‘ Drive like the devil , ’ he shouted , ‘ first to Gross &  Hankey ’s in Regent Street , and then to the Church of St. Monica in the  Edgeware Road . Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes ! ’  “ Away they went , and I was just wondering whether I should not do well  to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau , the coachman  with his coat only half - buttoned , and his tie under his ear , while all  the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles . It had n’t  pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it . I only  caught a glimpse of her at the moment , but she was a lovely woman , with  a face that a man might die for .  “ ‘ The Church of St. Monica , John , ’ she cried , ‘ and half a sovereign if  you reach it in twenty minutes . ’  “ This was quite too good to lose , Watson . I was just balancing whether  I should run for it , or whether I should perch behind her landau when a  cab came through the street . The driver looked twice at such a shabby  fare , but I jumped in before he could object . ‘ The Church of St.  Monica , ’ said I , ‘ and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty  minutes . ’ It was twenty - five minutes to twelve , and of course it was  clear enough what was in the wind .  “ My cabby drove fast . I do n’t think I ever drove faster , but the others  were there before us . The cab and the landau with their steaming horses  were in front of the door when I arrived . I paid the man and hurried  into the church . There was not a soul there save the two whom I had  followed and a surpliced clergyman , who seemed to be expostulating with  them . They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar . I  lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a  church . Suddenly , to my surprise , the three at the altar faced round to  me , and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me .  “ ‘ Thank God , ’ he cried . ‘ You ’ll do . Come !

"	"”  After this the robbers did not trust themselves in the house again ; but  it suited the four musicians of Bremen so well that they did not care  to leave it any more . And the mouth of him who last told this story is  still warm .  28 The Singing Bone  In a certain country there was once great lamentation over a wild boar  that laid waste the farmer ’s fields , killed the cattle , and ripped up  people ’s bodies with his tusks . The King promised a large reward to  anyone who would free the land from this plague ; but the beast was so  big and strong that no one dared to go near the forest in which it  lived . At last the King gave notice that whosoever should capture or  kill the wild boar should have his only daughter to wife .  Now there lived in the country two brothers , sons of a poor man , who  declared themselves willing to undertake the hazardous enterprise ; the  elder , who was crafty and shrewd , out of pride ; the younger , who was  innocent and simple , from a kind heart . The King said , “ In order that  you may be the more sure of finding the beast , you must go into the  forest from opposite sides . ” So the elder went in on the west side , and  the younger on the east .  When the younger had gone a short way , a little man stepped up to him .  He held in his hand a black spear and said , “ I give you this spear  because your heart is pure and good ; with this you can boldly attack  the wild boar , and it will do you no harm . ”  He thanked the little man , shouldered the spear , and went on  fearlessly .  Before long he saw the beast , which rushed at him ; but he held the  spear towards it , and in its blind fury it ran so swiftly against it  that its heart was cloven in twain . Then he took the monster on his  back and went homewards with it to the King .  As he came out at the other side of the wood , there stood at the  entrance a house where people were making merry with wine and dancing .  His elder brother had gone in here , and , thinking that after all the  boar would not run away from him , was going to drink until he felt  brave . But when he saw his young brother coming out of the wood laden  with his booty , his envious , evil heart gave

"<fairy>  Only the prince stopped behind for a moment , as though in indecision ;  and Evgenie Pavlovitch lingered too , for he had not collected his  scattered wits .
"	"But the Epanchins had not had time to get more than  twenty paces away when a scandalous episode occurred . The young  officer , Evgenie Pavlovitch ’s friend who had been conversing with  Aglaya , said aloud in a great state of indignation :  “ She ought to be whipped — that ’s the only way to deal with creatures  like that — she ought to be whipped ! ”  This gentleman was a confidant of Evgenie ’s , and had doubtless heard of  the carriage episode .  Nastasia turned to him . Her eyes flashed ; she rushed up to a young man  standing near , whom she did not know in the least , but who happened to  have in his hand a thin cane . Seizing this from him , she brought it  with all her force across the face of her insulter .  All this occurred , of course , in one instant of time .  The young officer , forgetting himself , sprang towards her . Nastasia ’s  followers were not by her at the moment ( the elderly gentleman having  disappeared altogether , and the younger man simply standing aside and  roaring with laughter ) .  In another moment , of course , the police would have been on the spot ,  and it would have gone hard with Nastasia Philipovna had not unexpected  aid appeared .  Muishkin , who was but a couple of steps away , had time to spring  forward and seize the officer ’s arms from behind .  The officer , tearing himself from the prince ’s grasp , pushed him so  violently backwards that he staggered a few steps and then subsided  into a chair .  But there were other defenders for Nastasia on the spot by this time .  The gentleman known as the “ boxer ” now confronted the enraged officer .  “ Keller is my name , sir ; ex - lieutenant , ” he said , very loud . “ If you  will accept me as champion of the fair sex , I am at your disposal .  English boxing has no secrets from me . I sympathize with you for the  insult you have received , but I ca n’t permit you to raise your hand  against a woman in public . If you prefer to meet me — as would be more  fitting to your rank — in some other manner , of course you understand me ,  captain . ”  But the young officer had recovered himself , and was no longer  listening . At this moment Rogojin appeared , elbowing through the crowd ;  he took Nastasia ’s hand , drew it through his arm , and quickly led her  away . He appeared

"	" “ Precisely . And the man who wrote the note is a German . Do you note the  peculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have from  all quarters received . ’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written  that . It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs . It only  remains , therefore , to discover what is wanted by this German who  writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his  face . And here he comes , if I am not mistaken , to resolve all our  doubts . ”  As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses ’ hoofs and grating  wheels against the curb , followed by a sharp pull at the bell . Holmes  whistled .  “ A pair , by the sound , ” said he . “ Yes , ” he continued , glancing out of  the window . “ A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties . A hundred  and fifty guineas apiece . There ’s money in this case , Watson , if there  is nothing else . ”  “ I think that I had better go , Holmes . ”  “ Not a bit , Doctor . Stay where you are .

Here he comes .  Sit down in that armchair , Doctor , and give us your best attention . ”  A slow and heavy step , which had been heard upon the stairs and in the  passage , paused immediately outside the door . Then there was a loud and  authoritative tap .  “ Come in ! ” said Holmes .  A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches  in height , with the chest and limbs of a Hercules . His dress was rich  with a richness which would , in England , be looked upon as akin to bad  taste . Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and  fronts of his double - breasted coat , while the deep blue cloak which was  thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame - coloured silk and  secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming  beryl . Boots which extended halfway up his calves , and which were  trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur , completed the impression of  barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance .

She went and asked for a  place ; she was a poor girl , she said , and would like to be hired . She  knew , however , that the King ’s son whom she had released from the iron  stove in the great forest was in the castle . Then she was taken as a  scullery - maid at low wages . But , already the King ’s son had another  maiden by his side whom he wanted to marry , for he thought that she had  long been dead .  In the evening , when she had washed up and was done , she felt in her  pocket and found the three nuts which the old toad had given her . She  cracked one with her teeth , and was going to eat the kernel when lo and  behold there was a stately royal garment in it ! But when the bride  heard of this she came and asked for the dress , and wanted to buy it ,  and said , “ It is not a dress for a servant - girl . ” But she said no , she  would not sell it , but if the bride would grant her one thing she  should have it , and that was , leave to sleep one night in her  bridegroom ’s chamber . The bride gave her permission because the dress  was so pretty , and she had never had one like it . When it was evening  she said to her bridegroom , “ That silly girl will sleep in thy room . ”  “ If thou art willing so am I , ” said he . She , however , gave him a glass  of wine in which she had poured a sleeping - draught . So the bridegroom  and the scullery - maid went to sleep in the room , and he slept so  soundly that she could not waken him .  She wept the whole night and cried , “ I set thee free when thou wert in  an iron stove in the wild forest , I sought thee , and walked over a  glass mountain , and three sharp swords , and a great lake before I found  thee , and yet thou wilt not hear me ! ”  The servants sat by the chamber - door , and heard how she thus wept the  whole night through , and in the morning they told it to their lord . And  the next evening when she had washed up , she opened the second nut , and  a far more beautiful dress

Then , and then only , under  such a roof , I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at  Barton . ”  “ I flatter myself , ” replied Elinor , “ that even under the disadvantage  of better rooms and a broader staircase , you will hereafter find your  own house as faultless as you now do this . ”  “ There certainly are circumstances , ” said Willoughby , “ which might  greatly endear it to me ; but this place will always have one claim of  my affection , which no other can possibly share . ”  Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne , whose fine eyes were  fixed so expressively on Willoughby , as plainly denoted how well she  understood him .  “ How often did I wish , ” added he , “ when I was at Allenham this time  twelvemonth , that Barton cottage were inhabited

While they thus traversed the wood , they heard in the  distance the cry of a damsel in great distress . When Erec heard the cry ,  he felt sure from the sound that it was the voice of one in trouble and  in need of help . Straightway calling Enide , he says : "" Lady , there is  some maiden who goes through the wood calling aloud . I take it that she  is in need of aid and succour . I am going to hasten in that direction  and see what her trouble is . Do you dismount and await me here , while  I go yonder . "" "" Gladly , sire , "" she says . Leaving her alone , he makes his  way until he found the damsel , who was going through the wood , lamenting  her lover whom two giants had taken and were leading away with very  cruel treatment . The maiden was rending her garments , and tearing her  hair and her tender crimson face . Erec sees her and , wondering greatly ,  begs her to tell him why she cries and weeps so sore . The maiden cries  and sighs again , then sobbing , says : "" Fair sire , it is no wonder if I  grieve , for I wish I were dead . I neither love nor prize my life , for my  lover has been led away prisoner by two wicked and cruel giants who are  his mortal enemies . God ! what shall I do ?

Watson , I fear that you will find it very slow , but  I shall only be away a couple of hours . ”  I walked down to the station with them , and then wandered through the  streets of the little town , finally returning to the hotel , where I lay  upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow - backed novel .  The puny plot of the story was so thin , however , when compared to the  deep mystery through which we were groping , and I found my attention  wander so continually from the action to the fact , that I at last flung  it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of  the events of the day . Supposing that this unhappy young man ’s story  were absolutely true , then what hellish thing , what absolutely  unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the  time when he parted from his father , and the moment when , drawn back by  his screams , he rushed into the glade ? It was something terrible and  deadly . What could it be ? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal  something to my medical instincts ? I rang the bell and called for the  weekly county paper , which contained a verbatim account of the inquest .  In the surgeon ’s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of  the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been  shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon . I marked the spot upon  my own head . Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind .  That was to some extent in favour of the accused , as when seen  quarrelling he was face to face with his father . Still , it did not go  for very much , for the older man might have turned his back before the  blow fell . Still , it might be worth while to call Holmes ’ attention to  it . Then there was the peculiar dying

"<fantasy> Right so came Sir Gaheris and told  King Arthur how Sir Tristram had smitten down Sir Palomides , and it was  at Sir Palomides ’ own request .
"	"Alas , said King Arthur , that was great  dishonour to Sir Palomides , inasmuch as Sir Tristram was sore wounded ,  and now may we all , kings , and knights , and men of worship , say that  Sir Tristram may be called a noble knight , and one of the best knights  that ever I saw the days of my life . For I will that ye all , kings and  knights , know , said King Arthur , that I never saw knight do so  marvellously as he hath done these three days ; for he was the first  that began and that longest held on , save this last day . And though he  was hurt , it was a manly adventure of two noble knights , and when two  noble men encounter needs must the one have the worse , like as God will  suffer at that time . As for me , said Sir Launcelot , for all the lands  that ever my father left me I would not have hurt Sir Tristram an I had  known him at that time ; that I hurt him was for I saw not his shield .  For an I had seen his black shield , I would not have meddled with him  for many causes ; for late he did as much for me as ever did knight , and  that is well known that he had ado with thirty knights , and no help  save Sir Dinadan . And one thing shall I promise , said Sir Launcelot ,  Sir Palomides shall repent it as in his unkindly dealing for to follow  that noble knight that I by mishap hurted thus . Sir Launcelot said all  the worship that might be said by Sir Tristram . Then King Arthur made a  great feast to all that would come . And thus we let pass King Arthur ,  and a little we will turn unto Sir Palomides , that after he had a fall  of Sir Tristram , he was nigh - hand araged out of his wit for despite of  Sir Tristram . And so he followed him by adventure . And as he came by a  river , in his woodness he would have made his horse to have leapt over ;  and the horse failed footing and fell in the river , wherefore Sir  Palomides was adread lest he should have been drowned ; and then he  avoided his horse , and swam to the land , and let his horse go down by  adventure .  CHAPTER XXXV . How Palomides came to the castle where Sir Tristram was ,  and of the quest that Sir Launcelot and ten knights made for Sir  Tristram .  And when he came to

GIDEON  By Wells Hastings ( 1878- )  [ From _ The Century Magazine _ , April , 1914 ; copyright , 1914 , by The  Century Co. ; republished by the author 's permission . ]  "" An ' de next ' frawg dat houn ' pup seen , he pass him by wide . ""  The house , which had hung upon every word , roared with laughter , and  shook with a storming volley of applause . Gideon bowed to right and to  left , low , grinning , assured comedy obeisances ; but as the laughter  and applause grew he shook his head , and signaled quietly for the  drop . He had answered many encores , and he was an instinctive artist .  It was part of the fuel of his vanity that his audience had never yet  had enough of him . Dramatic judgment , as well as dramatic sense of  delivery , was native to him , qualities which the shrewd Felix Stuhk ,  his manager and exultant discoverer , recognized and wisely trusted in .  Off stage Gideon was watched over like a child and a delicate  investment , but once behind the footlights he was allowed to go his  own triumphant gait .  It was small wonder that Stuhk deemed himself one of the cleverest  managers in the business ; that his narrow , blue - shaven face was  continually chiseled in smiles of complacent self - congratulation .

"<fairy> For it had not  been very long prior to the Pequod ’s sailing from Nantucket , that he  had been found one night lying prone upon the ground , and insensible ;  by some unknown , and seemingly inexplicable , unimaginable casualty , his  ivory limb having been so violently displaced , that it had stake - wise  smitten , and all but pierced his groin ; nor was it without extreme  difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured .
"	" Nor , at the time , had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind , that all  the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of  a former woe ; and he too plainly seemed to see , that as the most  poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as  the sweetest songster of the grove ; so , equally with every felicity ,  all miserable events do naturally beget their like . Yea , more than  equally , thought Ahab ; since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief  go further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy . For , not to hint of  this : that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings , that  while some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them  for the other world , but , on the contrary , shall be followed by the  joy - childlessness of all hell ’s despair ; whereas , some guilty mortal  miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally  progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave ; not at all to hint of  this , there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the  thing . For , thought Ahab , while even the highest earthly felicities  ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them , but , at  bottom , all heartwoes , a mystic significance , and , in some men , an  archangelic grandeur ; so do their diligent tracings - out not belie the  obvious deduction . To trail the genealogies of these high mortal  miseries , carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the  gods ; so that , in the face of all the glad , hay - making suns , and soft  cymballing , round harvest - moons , we must needs give in to this : that  the gods themselves are not for ever glad . The ineffaceable , sad  birth - mark in the brow of man , is but the stamp of sorrow in the  signers .  Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged , which perhaps might more  properly , in set way , have been disclosed before . With many other  particulars concerning Ahab , always had it remained a mystery to some ,  why it was , that for a certain period , both before and after the  sailing of the Pequod , he had hidden himself away with such  Grand - Lama - like exclusiveness ; and , for that one interval , sought  speechless refuge , as it were , among the marble senate of the dead .  Captain Peleg ’s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means  adequate ; though , indeed , as

"	"”  “ Oh , ho ! ” said the spring , “ then I will begin to flow , ” and began to  flow violently . And in the water everything was drowned , the girl , the  little tree , the little ash - heap , the little cart , the broom , the  little door , the little flea , the little louse , all together .  31 The Girl Without Hands  A certain miller had little by little fallen into poverty , and had  nothing left but his mill and a large apple - tree behind it . Once when  he had gone into the forest to fetch wood , an old man stepped up to him  whom he had never seen before , and said , “ Why dost thou plague thyself  with cutting wood , I will make thee rich , if thou wilt promise me what  is standing behind thy mill ? ” “ What can that be but my apple - tree ? ”  thought the miller , and said , “ Yes , ” and gave a written promise to the  stranger . He , however , laughed mockingly and said , “ When three years  have passed , I will come and carry away what belongs to me , ” and then  he went . When the miller got home , his wife came to meet him and said ,  “ Tell me , miller , from whence comes this sudden wealth into our house ?  All at once every box and chest was filled ; no one brought it in , and I  know not how it happened . ” He answered , “ It comes from a stranger who  met me in the forest , and promised me great treasure . I , in return ,  have promised him what stands behind the mill ; we can very well give  him the big apple - tree for it . ” “ Ah , husband , ” said the terrified wife ,  “ that must have been the devil ! He did not mean the apple - tree , but our  daughter , who was standing behind the mill sweeping the yard . ”  The miller ’s daughter was a beautiful , pious girl , and lived through  the three years in the fear of God and without sin . When therefore the  time was over , and the day came when the Evil - one was to fetch her , she  washed herself clean , and made a circle round herself with chalk . The  devil appeared quite early , but he could not come near to her . Angrily ,  he said to the miller , “ Take all water away from her , that she may no

"<fairy> These letters , entirely creditable though they  were to the statesmanship of the Grand Pensionary , would have been  accepted as evidence of treason by the maddened Orangists , and  Cornelius , instead of burning them , had left them in the keeping of his  godson , Van Baerle , a quiet , scholarly young man of Dordrecht , who was  utterly unaware of the nature of the packet .
"	" "" They will kill us if these papers are found , "" said John de Witt , and  opening the window , they heard the mob shouting , "" Death to traitors ! ""  In spite of fingers and wrists broken by the rack , Cornelius managed to  write a note .        DEAR GODSON : Burn the packet I gave you , burn without opening       or looking at it , so that you may not know the contents . The       secrets it contains bring death . Burn it , and you will have       saved both John and Cornelius .       Farewell , from your affectionate       CORNELIUS DE WITT .  Then a letter was given to Craeke , John de Witt 's faithful servant , who  at once set off for Dordrecht , and within a few minutes the two brothers  were driving away to the city gate . Rosa , the gaoler 's daughter , unknown  to her father , had opened the postern , and had herself bidden De Witt 's  coachman drive round to the rear of the prison , and by this means the  fury of the mob was , for the moment , evaded .  And now the clamour of the Orangists was at the prison door , for Tilly 's  horse had withdrawn on an order signed by the deputies in the town hall ,  and the people were raging to get within the Buytenhof .  The mob burst open the great gate , and yelling , "" Death to the traitors !  To the gallows with Cornelius de Witt ! "" poured in , only to find the  prisoner had escaped . But the escape was but from the prison , for the  city gate was locked when the carriage of the De Witts drove up , locked  by order of the deputies of the Town Hall , and a certain young man -- who  was none other than William , Prince of Orange -- held the key .  Before another gate could be reached the mob , streaming from the  Buytenhof , had overtaken the carriage , and the De Witts were at its  mercy .  The two men , whose lives had been spent in the welfare of their country ,  were massacred with unspeakable savagery , and their bodies , stripped ,  and hacked almost beyond recognition , were then strung up on a hastily  erected gibbet in the market - place .  When the worst had been done , the young man , who had secretly watched  the proceedings from the window of a neighbouring house , returned the  key to the gatekeeper .  Then the prince mounted a horse which an equerry held in waiting for  him , and galloped off to camp

And one of the women arose ,  and took the corpse from the saddle , and anointed it in a vessel of warm  water , which was below the door , and placed precious balsam upon it ; and  the man rose up alive , and came to the place where Peredur was , and  greeted him , and was joyful to see him .   And two other men came in upon  their saddles , and the maiden treated these two in the same manner as she  had done the first .   Then Peredur asked the chieftain wherefore it was  thus .   And they told him , that there was an Addanc in a cave , which slew  them once every day .   And thus they remained that night .  And next morning the youths arose to sally forth , and Peredur besought  them , for the sake of the ladies of their love , to permit him to go with  them ; but they refused him , saying , “ If thou shouldst be slain there ,  thou hast none to bring thee back to life again . ”   And they rode forward ,  and Peredur followed after them ; and , after they had disappeared out of  his sight , he came to a mound , whereon sat the fairest lady he had ever  beheld .   “ I know thy quest , ” said she ; “ thou art going to encounter the  Addanc , and he will slay thee , and that not by courage , but by craft .   He  has a cave , and at the entrance of the cave there is a stone pillar , and  he sees every one that enters , and none see him ; and from behind the  pillar he slays every one with a poisonous dart .   And if thou wouldst  pledge me thy faith to love me above all women , I would give thee a  stone , by which thou shouldst see him when thou goest in , and he should  not see thee . ”   “ I will , by my troth , ” said Peredur , “ for when first I  beheld thee I loved thee ; and where shall I seek thee ? ”   “ When thou  seekest me

And the ants said to him , "" Receive  from us the blessing of Heaven , and that which no man can give we will  give thee .

And when  Kai knew certainly that he was asleep , he made a pit under his feet , the  largest in the world , and he struck him a violent blow , and squeezed him  into the pit .

The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape ; he had bushy white  whiskers ; long white hair flowed from under his sombrero , and he wore  green goggles . When they came in , “ t’other ” was talking in a low voice ;  they sat down on the ground , facing the door , with their backs to the  wall , and the speaker continued his remarks . His manner became less  guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded :  “ No , ” said he , “ I ’ve thought it all over , and I do n’t like it . It ’s  dangerous . ”  “ Dangerous ! ” grunted the “ deaf and dumb ” Spaniard — to the vast surprise  of the boys . “ Milksop ! ”  This voice made the boys gasp and quake . It was Injun Joe ’s ! There was  silence for some time . Then Joe said :  “ What ’s any more dangerous than that job up yonder — but nothing ’s come of  it . ”  “ That ’s different . Away up the river so , and not another house about .  ’ Twon’t ever be known that we tried , anyway , long as we did n’t succeed . ”  “ Well , what ’s more dangerous than coming here in the daytime!—anybody  would suspicion us that saw us . ”  “ I know that .

I wanted to yesterday , only it  warn’t any use trying to stir out of here , with those infernal boys  playing over there on the hill right in full view . ”  “ Those infernal boys ” quaked again under the inspiration of this remark ,  and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and  concluded to wait a day . They wished in their hearts they had waited a  year .  The two men got out some food and made a luncheon . After a long and  thoughtful silence , Injun Joe said :  “ Look here , lad — you go back up the river where you belong . Wait there  till you hear from me .

I put case , said Sir Palomides ,  that ye were armed at all rights as well as I am , and I naked as ye be ,  what would you do to me now , by your true knighthood ? Ah , said Sir  Tristram , now I understand thee well , Sir Palomides , for now must I say  mine own judgment , and as God me bless , that I shall say shall not be  said for no fear that I have of thee . But this is all : wit Sir  Palomides , as at this time thou shouldest depart from me , for I would  not have ado with thee . No more will I , said Palomides , and therefore  ride forth on thy way . As for that I may choose , said Sir Tristram ,  either to ride or to abide . But Sir Palomides , said Sir Tristram , I  marvel of one thing , that thou that art so good a knight , that thou  wilt not be christened , and thy brother , Sir Safere , hath been  christened many a day .  CHAPTER XIII . How that Sir Tristram gat him harness of a knight which  was hurt , and how he overthrew Sir Palomides .  As for that , said Sir Palomides , I may not yet be christened for one  avow that I have made many years agone ; howbeit in my heart I believe  in Jesu Christ and his mild mother Mary ; but I have but one battle to  do , and when that is done I will be baptised with a good will . By my  head , said Tristram , as for one battle thou shalt not seek it no  longer . For God defend , said Sir Tristram , that through my default thou  shouldst longer live thus a Saracen , for yonder is a knight that ye ,  Sir Palomides , have hurt and smitten down . Now help me that I were  armed in his armour , and I shall soon fulfil thine avows . As ye will ,  said Palomides , so it shall be .  So they rode both unto that knight that sat upon a bank , and then Sir  Tristram saluted him , and he weakly saluted him again . Sir knight , said  Sir Tristram , I require you tell me your right name . Sir , he said , my  name is Sir Galleron of Galway , and knight of the Table Round . So God  me help , said Sir Tristram , I am right heavy of your hurts

And immediately we did begin to run downward , and with sore stumblings  in this place and that ; but not to halt us ; for we did be so mad as two  children for the gladsome light .  And we came down presently in the twelfth hour of that journey into the  warm light and wonder of the Country of the Seas .

And Naani alway to look every way about her , and to breathe very quick ,  and her eyes to be gone bright with wonder and the seeing of new things ,  and the coming of freedom from so great a dread .  And she turned , now , and did look upward into the dark of the Gorge , and  to spy upon the great mouth thereof , and to be feared then , and must run  a greater way downward into the lightness of the Country of the Seas ;  and to come once more to pause , and to look backward , and with an awe  and a relieved soul ; and so again to the wonder of the spreaded Country  and the great Sea ; and did near to laugh and cry in the same moment ,  with the amazement and gladness and great astonishment that did be upon  her . And she to turn constant this way and that , and to be never ceased  of looking , and of deep breathings of the wide air ; for never in that  life had she been in a broad place of light , as you shall have  perceived .  And we to feel , both , that there did be no more need to talk husht , as  we did alway in the gloom and narrow dark of the gorge . And surely she  to shout , as a child that doth try

And surely , I lookt at her ; but she did have her lids something  downward , when that she saw me turn ; and so in the end , I said naught ,  but went to my sleep , and had the Diskos very handy , as ever , beside me .

And I saw that she had no mind to be perverse whilst that I did slumber ;  but must now be nigh unto me , and quietly loving ; though nowise truly  ceased from her naughty acting that I did be as an hard slave master ,  because that I had whipt her ; yet she to have somewhat a truce with me ,  as my heart did know . But , indeed , she not to kiss me good - night upon  the mouth , in her dear usual and sober fashion .  And surely I did lie awhile , and pondered upon the Maid and upon all her  ways ; and I perceived that she kist me not , only because that she did  not be able to break utter from her perverseness , that did come from the  stirring of her nature . And truly , I did love her , and was half minded  that I turn about to her , and take her a moment into mine arms ; but yet  to abide from this , because that I was set that I wait awhile , and to  bring her to me thiswise , mayhaps .

"<fantasy>   Beside  them lay a good big basket that had hints about it of cold pie and wine :  a half dozen of young women stood by watching the work or the workers ,  both of which were worth watching , for the latter smote great strokes and  were very deft in their labour , and as handsome clean - built fellows as  you might find a dozen of in a summer day .
"	"  They were laughing and  talking merrily with each other and the women , but presently their  foreman looked up and saw our way stopped .   So he stayed his pick and  sang out , "" Spell ho , mates ! here are neighbours want to get past . ""  Whereon the others stopped also , and , drawing around us , helped the old  horse by easing our wheels over the half undone road , and then , like men  with a pleasant task on hand , hurried back to their work , only stopping  to give us a smiling good - day ; so that the sound of the picks broke out  again before Greylocks had taken to his jog - trot .   Dick looked back over  his shoulder at them and said :  "" They are in luck to - day : it 's right down good sport trying how much pick-  work one can get into an hour ; and I can see those neighbours know their  business well .   It is not a mere matter of strength getting on quickly  with such work ; is it , guest ? ""  "" I should think not , "" said I , "" but to tell you the truth , I have never  tried my hand at it . ""  "" Really ? "" said he gravely , "" that seems a pity ; it is good work for  hardening the muscles , and I like it ; though I admit it is pleasanter the  second week than the first .   Not that I am a good hand at it : the fellows  used to chaff me at one job where I was working , I remember , and sing out  to me , ' Well rowed , stroke ! '   ' Put your back into it , bow ! ' ""  "" Not much of a joke , "" quoth I.  "" Well , "" said Dick , "" everything seems like a joke when we have a pleasant  spell of work on , and good fellows merry about us ; we feels so happy , you  know . ""   Again I pondered silently .  CHAPTER VIII : AN OLD FRIEND  We now turned into a pleasant lane where the branches of great  plane - trees nearly met overhead , but behind them lay low houses standing  rather close together .  "" This is Long Acre , "" quoth Dick ; "" so there must once have been a  cornfield here .   How curious it is that places change so , and yet keep  their old names !   Just look how thick the houses stand ! and they are  still going on building , look you

"	"”  In much great joy were they for long while : wore one day , and another ,  and a third ; and it befell that they lay together in bed on a night , and  then said the dame : “ Sir , I pray and require of thee a gift . ”   “ Dame , ”  said he , “ ask , and I will give it , if give it I may . ”   “ Sir , ” she said ,  “ I crave leave of thee to go with thee on thy journey . ”  When Messire Thibault heard that , he was much sorrowful , and said : “ Dame ,  grievous thing would it be to thine heart , for the way is much longsome ,  and the land is much strange and much diverse . ”   She said : “ Sir , doubt  thou nought of me , for of such littlest squire that thou hast , shalt thou  be more hindered than of me . ”   “ Dame , ” said he , “ a - God ’s name , I grant it  thee . ”  Day came , and the tidings ran so far till the Count of Ponthieu knew it ,  and sent for Messire Thibault , and said : “ Thibault , thou art vowed a  pilgrim , as they tell me , and my daughter also ? ”   “ Sir , ” said he , “ that  is sooth . ”   “ Thibault , ” said the Count , “ concerning thee it is well , but  concerning my daughter it is heavy on me . ”   “ Sir , ” said Messire Thibault ,  “ I might not naysay her . ”   “ Thibault , ” said the Count , “ bestir ye when ye  will ; so hasten ye your palfreys , your nags , and your sumpter - beasts ; and  I will give you pennies and havings enow . ”   “ Sir , ” said Messire Thibault ,  “ great thank I give thee . ”  So then they arrayed them , and departed with great joy ; and they went so  far by their journeys , that they drew nigh to St. Jacque by less than two  days .  On a night they came to a good town , and in the evening Messire Thibault  called his host , and asked him concerning the road for the morrow , what  road they should find , and what like it might be ; and he said to him :  “ Fair sir , at the going forth from this town ye shall find somewhat of a  forest to pass through , and all the day after a

"<fantasy> And many there were that  King Arthur had made up of nought , and given them lands , might not then  say him a good word .
"	"Lo ye all Englishmen , see ye not what a mischief  here was ! for he that was the most king and knight of the world , and  most loved the fellowship of noble knights , and by him they were all  upholden , now might not these Englishmen hold them content with him . Lo  thus was the old custom and usage of this land ; and also men say that  we of this land have not yet lost nor forgotten that custom and usage .  Alas , this is a great default of us Englishmen , for there may no thing  please us no term . And so fared the people at that time , they were  better pleased with Sir Mordred than they were with King Arthur ; and  much people drew unto Sir Mordred , and said they would abide with him  for better and for worse . And so Sir Mordred drew with a great host to  Dover , for there he heard say that Sir Arthur would arrive , and so he  thought to beat his own father from his lands ; and the most part of all  England held with Sir Mordred , the people were so new - fangle .  CHAPTER II . How after that King Arthur had tidings , he returned and  came to Dover , where Sir Mordred met him to let his landing ; and of the  death of Sir Gawaine .  And so as Sir Mordred was at Dover with his host , there came King  Arthur with a great navy of ships , and galleys , and carracks . And there  was Sir Mordred ready awaiting upon his landing , to let his own father  to land upon the land that he was king over . Then there was launching  of great boats and small , and full of noble men of arms ; and there was  much slaughter of gentle knights , and many a full bold baron was laid  full low , on both parties . But King Arthur was so courageous that there  might no manner of knights let him to land , and his knights fiercely  followed him ; and so they landed maugre Sir Mordred and all his power ,  and put Sir Mordred aback , that he fled and all his people .  So when this battle was done , King Arthur let bury his people that were  dead . And then was noble Sir Gawaine found in a great boat , lying more  than half dead . When Sir Arthur wist that Sir Gawaine was laid so low ;  he went unto him ; and there the king made sorrow out of measure , and  took Sir Gawaine in his arms , and thrice he there swooned .

""  "" What do you mean ? "" growled Singh Rajah . "" There is no king in this  jungle but me ! "" "" Ah , sire , "" answered the jackal , "" in truth one would  think so , for you are very dreadful . Your very voice is death . But it  is as we say , for we , with our own eyes , have seen one with whom  you could not compete -- whose equal you can no more be than we are  yours -- whose face is as flaming fire , his step as thunder , and his  power supreme . "" "" It is impossible ! "" interrupted the old lion ; "" but  show me this rajah of whom you speak so much , that I may destroy him  instantly ! ""  Then the little jackals ran on before him until they reached a great  well , and , pointing down to his own reflection in the water , they  said , "" See , sire , there lives the terrible king of whom we spoke . ""  When Singh Rajah looked down the well he became very angry , for he  thought he saw another lion there . He roared and shook his great mane ,  and the shadow lion shook his and looked terribly defiant . At last ,  beside himself with rage at the violence of his opponent , Singh Rajah  sprang down to kill him at once , but no other lion was there -- only the  treacherous reflection -- and the sides of the well were so steep that  he could not get out again to punish the two jackals , who peeped over  the top . After struggling for some time in the deep water , he sank to  rise no more . And the little jackals threw stones down upon him from  above , and danced round and round the well , singing : "" Ao ! Ao ! Ao ! Ao !  The king of the forest is dead , is dead ! We have killed the great lion  who would have killed us ! Ao ! Ao ! Ao ! Ao ! Ring - a - ting -- ding - a - ting !  Ring - a

"<fairy> It took  a long time before Suddhoo admitted that this was just what he had asked  me to come for .
"	"Then he told me , in jerks and quavers , that the man who  said he cut seals was a sorcerer of the cleanest kind ; that every day he  gave Suddhoo news of the sick son in Peshawar more quickly than the  lightning could fly , and that this news was always corroborated by the  letters . Further , that he had told Suddhoo how a great danger was  threatening his son , which could be removed by clean _ jadoo _ ; and , of  course , heavy payment . I began to see exactly how the land lay , and told  Suddhoo that I also understood a little _ jadoo _ in the Western line , and  would go to his house to see that everything was done decently and in  order . We set off together ; and on the way Suddhoo told me that he had  paid the seal - cutter between one hundred and two hundred rupees already ;  and the _ jadoo _ of that night would cost two hundred more . Which was  cheap , he said , considering the greatness of his son 's danger ; but I do  not think he meant it .  The lights were all cloaked in the front of the house when we arrived . I  could hear awful noises from behind the seal - cutter 's shop - front , as if  some one were groaning his soul out . Suddhoo shook all over , and while we  groped our way upstairs told me that the _ jadoo _ had begun , Janoo and  Azizun met us at the stair - head , and told us that the _ jadoo_-work was  coming off in their rooms , because there was more space there . Janoo is a  lady of a freethinking turn of mind . She whispered that the _ jadoo _ was an  invention to get money out of Suddhoo , and that the seal - cutter would go  to a hot place when he died . Suddhoo was nearly crying with fear and old  age . He kept walking up and down the room in the half - light , repeating his  son 's name over and over again , and asking Azizun if the seal - cutter ought  not to make a reduction in the case of his own landlord . Janoo pulled me  over to the shadow in the recess of the carved bow - windows . The boards  were up , and the rooms were only lit by one tiny oil - lamp . There was no  chance of my being seen if I stayed still .  Presently , the groans below ceased , and we heard steps on the staircase .  That was the seal - cutter . He

"<fairy>  “ There ’s certainly too much pepper in that soup ! ” Alice said to  herself , as well as she could for sneezing .
"	" There was certainly too much of it in the air . Even the Duchess sneezed  occasionally ; and as for the baby , it was sneezing and howling  alternately without a moment ’s pause . The only things in the kitchen  that did not sneeze , were the cook , and a large cat which was sitting  on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear .  “ Please would you tell me , ” said Alice , a little timidly , for she was  not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first , “ why  your cat grins like that ? ”  “ It ’s a Cheshire cat , ” said the Duchess , “ and that ’s why . Pig ! ”  She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite  jumped ; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the  baby , and not to her , so she took courage , and went on again : —  “ I did n’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned ; in fact , I did n’t  know that cats _ could _ grin . ”  “ They all can , ” said the Duchess ; “ and most of ’em do . ”  “ I do n’t know of any that do , ” Alice said very politely , feeling quite  pleased to have got into a conversation .  “ You do n’t know much , ” said the Duchess ; “ and that ’s a fact . ”  Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark , and thought it would  be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation . While she  was trying to fix on one , the cook took the cauldron of soup off the  fire , and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at  the Duchess and the baby — the fire - irons came first ; then followed a  shower of saucepans , plates , and dishes . The Duchess took no notice of  them even when they hit her ; and the baby was howling so much already ,  that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not .  “ Oh , _ please _ mind what you ’re doing ! ” cried Alice , jumping up and down  in an agony of terror . “ Oh , there goes his _ precious _ nose ! ” as an  unusually large saucepan flew close by it , and very nearly carried it  off .  “ If everybody minded their own business , ” the Duchess said in a hoarse  growl , “ the world would go round a deal faster than it does

"<fairy> “ I can go no further in skill , ” said he ,  “ and yet things improve every day .
"	"” At last the King appointed him  court - tailor .  But how things do happen in the world ! On the very same day his former  comrade the shoemaker also became court - shoemaker . When the latter  caught sight of the tailor , and saw that he had once more two healthy  eyes , his conscience troubled him . “ Before he takes revenge on me , ”  thought he to himself , “ I must dig a pit for him . ” He , however , who  digs a pit for another , falls into it himself . In the evening when work  was over and it had grown dusk , he stole to the King and said , “ Lord  King , the tailor is an arrogant fellow and has boasted that he will get  the gold crown back again which was lost in ancient times . ” “ That would  please me very much , ” said the King , and he caused the tailor to be  brought before him next morning , and ordered him to get the crown back  again , or to leave the town for ever . “ Oho ! ” thought the tailor , “ a  rogue gives more than he has got . If the surly King wants me to do what  can be done by no one , I will not wait till morning , but will go out of  the town at once , to - day . ” He packed up his bundle , therefore , but when  he was without the gate he could not help being sorry to give up his  good fortune , and turn his back on the town in which all had gone so  well with him . He came to the pond where he had made the acquaintance  of the ducks ; at that very moment the old one whose young ones he had  spared , was sitting there by the shore , pluming herself with her beak .  She knew him again instantly , and asked why he was hanging his head so ?  “ Thou wilt not be surprised when thou hearest what has befallen me , ”  replied the tailor , and told her his fate . “ If that be all , ” said the  duck , “ we can help thee . The crown fell into the water , and lies down  below at the bottom ; we will soon bring it up again for thee . In the  meantime just spread out thy handkerchief on the bank . ” She dived down  with her twelve young ones , and in five minutes she was up again and  sat with the crown resting on her wings , and the twelve young ones were  swimming round

"<fairy> ” When the feast was announced , the youth  went out to the forest , and called Iron John .
"	"“ What dost thou desire ? ”  asked he . “ That I may catch the King ’s daughter ’s golden apple . ” “ It is  as safe as if thou hadst it already , ” said Iron John . “ Thou shalt  likewise have a suit of red armour for the occasion , and ride on a  spirited chestnut - horse . ” When the day came , the youth galloped to the  spot , took his place amongst the knights , and was recognized by no one .  The King ’s daughter came forward , and threw a golden apple to the  knights , but none of them caught it but he , only as soon as he had it  he galloped away .  On the second day Iron John equipped him as a white knight , and gave  him a white horse . Again he was the only one who caught the apple , and  he did not linger an instant , but galloped off with it . The King grew  angry , and said , “ That is not allowed ; he must appear before me and  tell his name . ” He gave the order that if the knight who caught the  apple , should go away again they should pursue him , and if he would not  come back willingly , they were to cut him down and stab him .  On the third day , he received from Iron John a suit of black armour and  a black horse , and again he caught the apple . But when he was riding  off with it , the King ’s attendants pursued him , and one of them got so  near him that he wounded the youth ’s leg with the point of his sword .  The youth nevertheless escaped from them , but his horse leapt so  violently that the helmet fell from the youth ’s head , and they could  see that he had golden hair . They rode back and announced this to the  King .  The following day the King ’s daughter asked the gardener about his boy .  “ He is at work in the garden ; the queer creature has been at the  festival too , and only came home yesterday evening ; he has likewise  shown my children three golden apples which he has won . ”  The King had him summoned into his presence , and he came and again had  his little cap on his head . But the King ’s daughter went up to him and  took it off , and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders , and  he was so handsome that all were amazed . “ Art thou the knight who came  every day to

"	" There was much gossip about the unknown king of Spor , who had never yet  been seen by any one except his subjects ; and some thought he must be  one of the huge giants of Spor ; and others claimed he was a dwarf , like  his tiny but ferocious dart - slingers ; and still others imagined him one  of the barbarian tribe , or a fellow to the terrible Gray Men .   But , of  course , no one knew positively , and all these guesses were very wide of  the mark .   The only certainty about this king was that his giants ,  dwarfs , barbarians and Gray Men meekly acknowledged his rule and obeyed  his slightest wish ; for though they might be terrible to others , their  king was still more terrible to them .  Into this Kingdom of Spor Prince Marvel and Nerle had now penetrated  and , neither knowing nor caring where they were , continued along the  faintly defined paths the horses had found .   Presently , however , they  were startled by a peal of shrill , elfish laughter , and raising their  eyes they beheld a horrid - looking old man seated upon a high rock near  by .  "" Why do you laugh ? "" asked Prince Marvel , stopping his horse .  "" Have you been invited ?   Tell me -- have you been invited ? "" demanded the  old man , chuckling to himself as if much amused .  "" Invited where ? "" inquired the prince .  "" To Spor , stupid !   To the Kingdom of Spor !   To the land of King  Terribus ! "" shrieked the old man , going into violent peals of laughter .  "" We go and come as we please , "" answered Prince Marvel , calmly .  "" Go -- yes !   Go if you will .   But you 'll never come back -- never ! never !  never ! "" The little old man seemed to consider this such a good joke  that he bent nearly double with laughing , and so lost his balance and  toppled off the rock , disappearing from their view ; but they could hear  him laugh long after they had passed on and left him far behind them .  "" A strange creature ! "" exclaimed the prince thoughtfully .  "" But perhaps he speaks truth , "" answered Nerle , "" if , in fact , we have  been rash enough to enter the Kingdom of Spor .   Even my father , the  bravest baron in Heg , has never dared venture within the borders of  Spor .   For all men fear its mysterious king .

"<fairy> These remarks may serve as a preface to the following  adventures , which chanced upon a summer night , not far from a hundred  years ago .
"	"The reader , in order to avoid a long and dry detail of  colonial affairs , is requested to dispense with an account of the train  of circumstances that had caused much temporary inflammation of the  popular mind .  It was near nine o'clock of a moonlight evening , when a boat crossed  the ferry with a single passenger , who had obtained his conveyance at  that unusual hour by the promise of an extra fare . While he stood on  the landing - place , searching in either pocket for the means of  fulfilling his agreement , the ferryman lifted a lantern , by the aid of  which , and the newly risen moon , he took a very accurate survey of the  stranger 's figure . He was a youth of barely eighteen years , evidently  country - bred , and now , as it should seem , upon his first visit to town .  He was clad in a coarse gray coat , well worn , but in excellent repair ;  his under garments were durably constructed of leather , and fitted  tight to a pair of serviceable and well - shaped limbs ; his stockings of  blue yarn were the incontrovertible work of a mother or a sister ; and  on his head was a three - cornered hat , which in its better days had  perhaps sheltered the graver brow of the lad 's father . Under his left  arm was a heavy cudgel formed of an oak sapling , and retaining a part  of the hardened root ; and his equipment was completed by a wallet , not  so abundantly stocked as to incommode the vigorous shoulders on which  it hung . Brown , curly hair , well - shaped features , and bright , cheerful  eyes were nature 's gifts , and worth all that art could have done for  his adornment .  The youth , one of whose names was Robin , finally drew from his pocket  the half of a little province bill of five shillings , which , in the  depreciation in that sort of currency , did but satisfy the ferryman 's  demand , with the surplus of a sexangular piece of parchment , valued at  three pence . He then walked forward into the town , with as light a step  as if his day 's journey had not already exceeded thirty miles , and with  as eager an eye as if he were entering London city , instead of the  little metropolis of a New England colony . Before Robin had proceeded  far , however , it occurred to him that he knew not whither to direct his  steps ; so he paused , and looked up and down the narrow street , 
"
"<fantasy> In a few minutes he came abreast of this small road ,  and saw an ass and cart piled with pots and pans , and walking beside  this there were two men and a woman .
"	"The men and the woman were talking  together loudly , even fiercely , and the ass was drawing his cart along  the road without requiring assistance or direction . While there was a  road he walked on it : when he might come to a cross road he would turn  to the right : when a man said “ whoh ” he would stop : when he said “ hike ”   he would go backwards , and when he said “ yep ” he would go on again . That  was life , and if one questioned it , one was hit with a stick , or a boot ,  or a lump of rock : if one continued walking nothing happened , and that  was happiness .  The Philosopher saluted this cavalcade .  “ God be with you , ” said he .  “ God and Mary be with you , ” said the first man .  “ God , and Mary , and Patrick be with you , ” said the second man .  “ God , and Mary , and Patrick , and Brigid be with you , ” said the woman .  The ass , however , did not say a thing . As the word “ whoh ” had not  entered into the conversation he knew it was none of his business , and  so he turned to the right on the new path and continued his journey .  “ Where are you going to , stranger , ” said the first man .  “ I am going to visit Angus Og , ” replied the Philosopher .  The man gave him a quick look .  “ Well , ” said he , “ that ’s the queerest story I ever heard . Listen here , ”   he called to the others , “ this man is looking for Angus Og . ”  The other man and woman came closer .  “ What would you be wanting with Angus Og , Mister Honey ? ” said the woman .  “ Oh , ” replied the Philosopher , “ it ’s a particular thing , a family  matter . ”  There was silence for a few minutes , and they all stepped onwards behind  the ass and cart .  “ How do you know where to look for himself ? ” said the first man again :  “ maybe you got the place where he lives written down in an old book or  on a carved stone ? ”  “ Or did you find the staff of Amergin or of Ossian in a bog and it  written from the top to the bottom with signs ? ” said the second man .  “ No , ” said the Philosopher , “ it is

"<fairy> Just as the mother was going to her work , the sick girl fixed her  gaze on the lowest pane of the window .
"	""" Mother , "" she exclaimed , "" what  can that little green thing be that peeps in at the window ? It is moving  in the wind . ""  The mother stepped to the window and half opened it . "" Oh ! "" she said ,  "" there is actually a little pea that has taken root and is putting out  its green leaves . How could it have got into this crack ? Well , now , here  is a little garden for you to amuse yourself with . "" So the bed of the  sick girl was drawn nearer to the window , that she might see the budding  plant ; and the mother went forth to her work .  "" Mother , I believe I shall get well , "" said the sick child in the  evening . "" The sun has shone in here so bright and warm to - day , and the  little pea is growing so fast , that I feel better , too , and think I  shall get up and go out into the warm sunshine again . ""  "" God grant it ! "" said the mother , but she did not believe it would be so .  She took a little stick and propped up the green plant which had given  her daughter such pleasure , so that it might not be broken by the winds .  She tied the piece of string to the window - sill and to the upper part of  the frame , so that the pea tendrils might have something to twine round .  And the plant shot up so fast that one could almost see it grow from day  to day .  "" A flower is really coming , "" said the mother one morning . At last she  was beginning to let herself hope that her little sick daughter might  indeed recover . She remembered that for some time the child had spoken  more cheerfully , and that during the last few days she had raised  herself in bed in the morning to look with sparkling eyes at her little  garden which contained but a single pea plant .  A week later the invalid sat up by the open window a whole hour , feeling  quite happy in the warm sunshine , while outside grew the little plant ,  and on it a pink pea blossom in full bloom . The little maiden bent down  and gently kissed the delicate leaves . This day was like a festival to  her .  "" Our heavenly Father himself has planted that pea and made it grow and  flourish , to bring joy to you and hope to me , my blessed child , "" said  the happy mother ,

"<fantasy>   At first Eric o ' Lincoln thought that he would gain an  easy advantage , so he came forth as if he would say , "" Watch , good  people , how that I carve you this cockerel right speedily "" ; but he  presently found it to be no such speedy matter .
"	"  Right deftly he struck ,  and with great skill of fence , but he had found his match in Little  John .   Once , twice , thrice , he struck , and three times Little John  turned the blows to the left hand and to the right . Then quickly and  with a dainty backhanded blow , he rapped Eric beneath his guard so  shrewdly that it made his head ring again . Then Eric stepped back to  gather his wits , while a great shout went up and all were glad that  Nottingham had cracked Lincoln 's crown ; and thus ended the first bout of  the game .  Then presently the director of the sport cried , "" Play ! "" and they came  together again ; but now Eric played warily , for he found his man was of  right good mettle , and also he had no sweet memory of the blow that he  had got ; so this bout neither Little John nor the Lincoln man caught a  stroke within his guard .   Then , after a while , they parted again , and  this made the second bout .  Then for the third time they came together , and at first Eric strove to  be wary , as he had been before ; but , growing mad at finding himself so  foiled , he lost his wits and began to rain blows so fiercely and so fast  that they rattled like hail on penthouse roof ; but , in spite of all , he  did not reach within Little John 's guard . Then at last Little John saw  his chance and seized it right cleverly . Once more , with a quick blow ,  he rapped Eric beside the head , and ere he could regain himself , Little  John slipped his right hand down to his left and , with a swinging blow ,  smote the other so sorely upon the crown that down he fell as though he  would never move again .  Then the people shouted so loud that folk came running from all about to  see what was the ado ; while Little John leaped down from the stand and  gave the staff back to him that had lent it to him .

"<fairy>  One morning she danced past a well - known door .
"	"Within was the sound of a  psalm , and presently a coffin strewn with flowers was borne out . She  knew that her friend , the old lady , was dead , and in her heart she felt  that she was abandoned by all on earth and condemned by God 's angel in  heaven .  Still on she danced -- for she could not stop -- through thorns and briers ,  while her feet bled . Finally , she danced to a lonely little house where  she knew that the executioner dwelt , and she tapped at the window ,  saying , "" Come out , come out ! I can not come in , for I must dance . ""  The man said , "" Do you know who I am and what I do ? ""  "" Yes , "" said Karen ; "" but do not strike off my head , for then I could not  live to repent of my sin . Strike off my feet , that I may be rid of my  red shoes . ""  Then she confessed her sin , and the executioner struck off the red  shoes , which danced away over the fields and into the deep wood . To  Karen it seemed that the feet had gone with the shoes , for she had  almost lost the power of walking .  "" Now I have suffered enough for the red shoes , "" she said ; "" I will go to  the church , that people may see me . "" But no sooner had she hobbled to  the church door than the shoes danced before her and frightened her  back .  All that week she endured the keenest sorrow and shed many bitter tears .  When Sunday came , she said : "" I am sure I must have suffered and striven  enough by this time . I am quite as good , I dare say , as many who are  holding their heads high in the church . "" So she took courage and went  again . But before she reached the churchyard gate the red shoes were  dancing there , and she turned back again in terror , more deeply  sorrowful than ever for her sin .  She then went to the pastor 's house and begged as a favor to be taken  into the family 's service , promising to be diligent and faithful . She  did not want wages , she said , only a home with good people . The  clergyman 's wife pitied her and granted her request , and she proved  industrious and very thoughtful .  Earnestly she listened when at evening the preacher read aloud the Holy  Scriptures . All the children came to love her

"<fantasy>   All other moods save this had been exhausted : the unceasing  criticism , the boundless curiosity in the ways and thoughts of man , which  was the mood of the ancient Greek , to whom these things were not so much  a means , as an end , was gone past recovery ; nor had there been really any  shadow of it in the so - called science of the nineteenth century , which ,  as you must know , was in the main an appendage to the commercial system ;  nay , not seldom an appendage to the police of that system .
"	"  In spite of  appearances , it was limited and cowardly , because it did not really  believe in itself .   It was the outcome , as it was the sole relief , of the  unhappiness of the period which made life so bitter even to the rich , and  which , as you may see with your bodily eyes , the great change has swept  away .   More akin to our way of looking at life was the spirit of the  Middle Ages , to whom heaven and the life of the next world was such a  reality , that it became to them a part of the life upon the earth ; which  accordingly they loved and adorned , in spite of the ascetic doctrines of  their formal creed , which bade them contemn it .  "" But that also , with its assured belief in heaven and hell as two  countries in which to live , has gone , and now we do , both in word and in  deed , believe in the continuous life of the world of men , and as it were ,  add every day of that common life to the little stock of days which our  own mere individual experience wins for us : and consequently we are  happy .   Do you wonder at it ?   In times past , indeed , men were told to  love their kind , to believe in the religion of humanity , and so forth .  But look you , just in the degree that a man had elevation of mind and  refinement enough to be able to value this idea , was he repelled by the  obvious aspect of the individuals composing the mass which he was to  worship ; and he could only evade that repulsion by making a conventional  abstraction of mankind that had little actual or historical relation to  the race ; which to his eyes was divided into blind tyrants on the one  hand and apathetic degraded slaves on the other .   But now , where is the  difficulty in accepting the religion of humanity , when the men and women  who go to make up humanity are free , happy , and energetic at least , and  most commonly beautiful of body also , and surrounded by beautiful things  of their own fashioning , and a nature bettered and not worsened by  contact with mankind ?   This is what this age of the world has reserved  for us . ""  "" It seems true , "" said I , "" or ought to be , if what my eyes have seen is a  token of the general life you lead .

"	" Much have all the barons spoken that night of the black knight ,  for they spoke of nought else . On the morrow they returned to  arms , all without summons and without entreaty . Lancelot of the  Lake has dashed forth to make the first joust ; for no coward is  he ; with upright lance he awaits the joust . Lo ! Cliges , greener  than meadow grass , galloping on a dun , long - maned steed . Where  Cliges pricks on the tawny steed , there is none , whether decked  with youth 's luxuriant locks or bald , who does not behold him  with wonder ; and they say on both sides : "" This man is in all  respects much nobler and more skilful than he of yesterday with  the black arms , just as the pine is fairer than the beech , and  the laurel than the elder . But not yet have we learned who he of  yesterday was ; but we will learn this very day who this one is .  If anyone know it , let him tell us . "" Each said : "" I know him not ,  never did I see him before to my thinking . But he is fairer than  the knight of yesterday and fairer than Lancelot of the Lake . If  he were arrayed in a sack and Lancelot in silver and gold , yet  this man would still be fairer . "" Thus all side with Cliges ; and  the two prick their steeds as fast as they can spur and encounter  one another . Cliges proceeds to deal such a blow on the golden  shield with the painted lion , that he hurls its bearer from the  saddle and fell on him in order to receive his submission .  Lancelot could not defend himself and has given his parole . Then  the noise and the din and the crash of lances has begun . Those  who were on Cliges ' side have all their trust in him ; for he whom  he strikes after due challenge given will never be so strong but  that he must needs fall from his horse to the ground . Cliges ,  this day , wrought so bravely , and threw down and captured so  many , that he has pleased those on his side twice as much , and  has had twice as much praise from them as he had the day before .  When evening has come he has repaired to his lodging as quickly  as he could ; and speedily bids the red shield and the other  armour be brought forth .

"	"When she was grown up the King  looked at her one day , and saw that in every respect she was like his  late wife , and suddenly felt a violent love for her . Then he spake to  his councillors , “ I will marry my daughter , for she is the counterpart  of my late wife , otherwise I can find no bride who resembles her . ” When  the councillors heard that , they were shocked , and said , “ God has  forbidden a father to marry his daughter , no good can come from such a  crime , and the kingdom will be involved in the ruin . ”  The daughter was still more shocked when she became aware of her  father ’s resolution , but hoped to turn him from his design . Then she  said to him , “ Before I fulfil your wish , I must have three dresses , one  as golden as the sun , one as silvery as the moon , and one as bright as  the stars ; besides this , I wish for a mantle of a thousand different  kinds of fur and hair joined together , and one of every kind of animal  in your kingdom must give a piece of his skin for it . ” But she thought ,  “ To get that will be quite impossible , and thus I shall divert my  father from his wicked intentions . ” The King , however , did not give it  up , and the cleverest maidens in his kingdom had to weave the three  dresses , one as golden as the sun , one as silvery as the moon , and one  as bright as the stars , and his huntsmen had to catch one of every kind  of animal in the whole of his kingdom , and take from it a piece of its  skin , and out of these was made a mantle of a thousand different kinds  of fur . At length , when all was ready , the King caused the mantle to be  brought , spread it out before her , and said , “ The wedding shall be  to - morrow . ”  When , therefore , the King ’s daughter saw that there was no longer any  hope of turning her father ’s heart , she resolved to run away from him .  In the night whilst every one was asleep , she got up , and took three  different things from her treasures , a golden ring , a golden  spinning - wheel , and a golden reel . The three dresses of the sun , moon ,  and stars she put into a nutshell , put on her mantle of all kinds of  fur

When they had walked on for a great distance , they  came to the body , and at last to the head also . “ Why , ” said the prince ,  “ what a tall rascal thou art ! ” “ Oh , ” replied the Tall One , “ that is  nothing at all yet ; when I really stretch out my limbs , I am three  thousand times as tall , and taller than the highest mountain on earth .  I will gladly enter your service , if you will take me . ” “ Come with me , ”  said the prince , “ I can make use of thee . ” They went onwards and found  a man sitting by the road who had bound up his eyes .

Boats , boats ! ”  Soon all the boats but Starbuck ’s were dropped ; all the boat - sails  set — all the paddles plying ; with rippling swiftness , shooting to  leeward ; and Ahab heading the onset . A pale , death - glimmer lit up  Fedallah ’s sunken eyes ; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth .  Like noiseless nautilus shells , their light prows sped through the sea ;  but only slowly they neared the foe . As they neared him , the ocean grew  still more smooth ; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves ; seemed a  noon - meadow , so serenely it spread . At length the breathless hunter  came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey , that his entire dazzling  hump was distinctly visible , sliding along the sea as if an isolated  thing , and continually set in a revolving ring of finest , fleecy ,  greenish foam . He saw the vast , involved wrinkles of the slightly  projecting head beyond . Before it , far out on the soft Turkish - rugged  waters , went the glistening white shadow from his broad , milky  forehead , a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade ; and  behind , the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving  valley of his steady wake ; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and  danced by his side . But these were broken again by the light toes of  hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea , alternate with their  fitful flight ; and like to some flag - staff rising from the painted hull  of an argosy , the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected  from the white whale ’s back ; and at intervals one of the cloud of  soft - toed fowls hovering , and to and fro skimming like a canopy over  the fish , silently perched and rocked on this pole , the long tail  feathers streaming like pennons .  A gentle joyousness — a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness , invested  the gliding whale . Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with  ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns ; his lovely , leering  eyes sideways intent upon the maid ; with smooth bewitching fleetness ,  rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete ; not Jove , not that  great majesty Supreme ! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so  divinely swam .  On each soft side — coincident with the parted swell , that but once  leaving him , then flowed so wide away

"	" But now what to do with it was a question of vital importance . She  dared not relight her lamp and she was helpless when out of her chair .  So she put back the cushion , slid from the bed into the chair and  wheeled herself in the dark to her dresser , which had a chenille cover .  Underneath this cover she spread the letter , deeming that so simple a  hiding - place was likely to be overlooked in a hasty search and feeling  that the letter would be safe there for the night , at least .  She now returned to her bed . There was no use trying to resew the  cushion in the dark . She lay awake for a long time , feeling a certain  thrill of delight in the belief that she was a conspirator despite her  crippled condition and that she was conspiring for the benefit of her  dear friend Mary Louise . Finally she sank into a deep slumber and did  not waken till the sun was streaming in at the window and Mary Louise  knocked upon her door to call her .  "" You 're lazy this morning , "" laughed Mary Louise , entering . "" Let me help  you dress for breakfast . ""  Irene thanked her . No one but this girl friend was ever permitted to  assist her in dressing , as she felt proud of her ability to serve  herself . Her toilet was almost complete when Mary Louise suddenly  exclaimed :  "" Why , what has become of your chair cushion ? ""  Irene looked toward the chair . The cushion was gone .

"<fantasy>  But when the Master came back to knowledge of that present , he would  rouse and chide , and they , all those lesser ones , would fly swiftly and  guiltily to their various works ; and yet , so I have thought since , each  with a muddled and bewildered and thoughtful air upon him ; and hungry  they were for more , and ever wondering and setting questions about .
"	" And so it was also with those others -- those learned ones who were not of  the Tower of Observation , and who disbelieved even whilst they hungered .  Listen would they , though I talked from the first hour , which was the  "" dawn , "" to the fifteenth hour , which was the beginning of the "" night "" ;  for the Sleep - Time was set thus , after other usage and experiment . And ,  odd whiles , I found that there were among them , men of extraordinary  learning who upheld my tellings as tales of verity ; and so there was a  faction ; but , later , there grew more to believe ; and whether they  believed , or not , all were ready to listen ; so that I might have spended  my days in talk ; only that I had my work to do .  But the Master Monstruwacan believed from the beginning , and was wise  always to understand ; so that I loved him for this , as for many another  dear quality .  And so , as may be conceived , among all those millions I was singled out  to be known ; for the stories that I told went downward through a  thousand cities ; and , presently , in the lowest tier of the Underground  Fields , an hundred miles deep in the earth below the Redoubt , I found  that the very ploughboys knew something concerning my tellings ; and  gathered about me one time and another when the Master Monstruwacan and  I had gone down , regarding some matter that dealt with the Earth - Current  and our Instruments .  And of the Underground Fields ( though in that age we called them no more  than "" The Fields "" ) I should set down a little ; for they were the  mightiest work of this world ; so that even the Last Redoubt was but a  small thing beside them . An hundred miles deep lay the lowest of the  Underground Fields , and was an hundred miles from side to side , every  way ; and above it there were three hundred and six fields , each one less  in area than that beneath ; and in this wise they tapered , until the  topmost field which lay direct beneath the lowermost floor of the Great  Redoubt , was but four miles every way .  And thus it will be seen that these fields , lying one beneath the other ,  formed a mighty and incredible Pyramid of Country Lands in the deep  earth , an hundred miles from the base unto the topmost field .

So not  being able to say why I wanted the locks away -- which , indeed , I did n't do  at all -- I held my peace .   But Walter said--  "" You see , guest , this is not an age of inventions .

This , and some other things , have set me all abroad  again , and as fate seems determined to make us chums for this  voyage -- why -- well , frankly , I should be glad to know if you be boy or  girl ?   If you are as I am , no more nor less then -- for I like  you -- there 's my hand in comradeship . If you are otherwise , as those  sleek outlines seem to promise -- why , here 's my hand again !   But man or  woman you must be -- come , which is it ? ""  If I had been perplexed before , to watch that boy now was more curious  than ever .   He drew back from me with a show of wounded dignity , then  bit his lips , and sighed , and stared , and frowned .   "" Come , "" I said  laughingly , "" speak !   it engenders ambiguity to be so ambiguous of  gender ! ' Tis no great matter , yes or no , a plain answer will set us  fairly in our friendship ; if it is comrade , then comrade let it be ; if  maid , why , I shall not quarrel with that , though it cost me a likely  messmate .

"<fantasy> And so you shall conceive  how that I did slide very quiet from bush unto bush ; for I had alway in  all my life had a very dread fear of this place ; and oft did I peer out  into the dim grey light of the lonesome plain unto my left ; and would  think sometimes to perceive the shapes of the Silent Ones stood vague  and watchful ; yet , on the instant , to see nothing .
"	" And thus I did go onward , and came presently to a part where the grey  plain did stretch out a bareness into the Night Land to my front ; so  that my way ended , unless I did make a long passing round about .  And I sat there among the moss - bushes , and did consider , and lookt out  cunningly through a spy - hole of the bush in which I did sit . And I  perceived that the part of the plain which did jut bareness into the  Land before me had no greatness of size ; but might be passed swiftly in  but a little running . And this thing should save me a wearisome going  round ; so that I made to consider it with a serious mind ; and all the  time did I search the bare greyness before me , and saw presently that it  was surely empty .  And I made to adventure myself across , running very swift until I had  come to the far side . And lo ! as I did go to rise up out of the bush ,  mine eyes were opened , as it were , and I saw that there was something  amid the constant greyness ; and I fell quickly into the bush ; and did  sweat very chill ; but yet did haste to look .  And I saw now that there were , in truth , matters that did show vague  upon that part of the plain that was before me . And I did peer very  constant and anxious , and , behold , I saw that there was facing me , a  great line of quiet and lofty figures , shrouded unto their feet ; and  they moved not , neither made they any sound ; but stood there amid the  greyness , and did seem to make an unending watch upon me ; so that my  heart went unto weakness , and I did feel that there was no power of the  moss - bushes to hide me ; for , in verity , they that stood so silent were  certain of the Silent Ones ; and I was very nigh to the Place of  Destruction .  Now , I moved not for a time ; but was made stiff by the greatness of my  fear . Yet I was presently aware that the Silent Ones came not towards  me ; but stood quiet ; as that they did mind not to slay me , if but I did  keep from that Place .  And there grew therefrom a little courage into mine heart , and I obeyed  my spirit , and took an hold of my strength and went slowly backward in  the

"<fairy>  When she got back to the Cheshire Cat , she was surprised to find quite  a large crowd collected round it : there was a dispute going on between  the executioner , the King , and the Queen , who were all talking at once ,  while all the rest were quite silent , and looked very uncomfortable .
"	" The moment Alice appeared , she was appealed to by all three to settle  the question , and they repeated their arguments to her , though , as they  all spoke at once , she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly  what they said .  The executioner ’s argument was , that you could n’t cut off a head unless  there was a body to cut it off from : that he had never had to do such a  thing before , and he was n’t going to begin at _ his _ time of life .  The King ’s argument was , that anything that had a head could be  beheaded , and that you were n’t to talk nonsense .  The Queen ’s argument was , that if something was n’t done about it in  less than no time she ’d have everybody executed , all round . ( It was  this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and  anxious . )  Alice could think of nothing else to say but “ It belongs to the  Duchess : you ’d better ask _ her _ about it . ”  “ She ’s in prison , ” the Queen said to the executioner : “ fetch her here . ”  And the executioner went off like an arrow .  The Cat ’s head began fading away the moment he was gone , and , by the  time he had come back with the Duchess , it had entirely disappeared ; so  the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it ,  while the rest of the party went back to the game .  CHAPTER IX .  The Mock Turtle ’s Story  “ You ca n’t think how glad I am to see you again , you dear old thing ! ”  said the Duchess , as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice ’s ,  and they walked off together .  Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper , and thought  to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so  savage when they met in the kitchen .  “ When _ I ’m _ a Duchess , ” she said to herself , ( not in a very hopeful  tone though ) , “ I wo n’t have any pepper in my kitchen _ at all _ . Soup  does very well without — Maybe it ’s always pepper that makes people  hot - tempered , ” she went on , very much pleased at having found out a new  kind of rule , “ and vinegar that makes them sour — and camomile that makes  them bitter — and — and

"<fairy> If I give birth to a little son , I will put  up a white flag , and then you may venture to come back , but if I bear a  daughter , I will hoist a red flag , and then fly hence as quickly as you  are able , and may the good God protect you .
"	"And every night I will rise  up and pray for you — in winter that you may be able to warm yourself at  a fire , and in summer that you may not faint away in the heat . ”  After she had blessed her sons therefore , they went forth into the  forest . They each kept watch in turn , and sat on the highest oak and  looked towards the tower . When eleven days had passed and the turn came  to Benjamin , he saw that a flag was being raised . It was , however , not  the white , but the blood - red flag which announced that they were all to  die . When the brothers heard that , they were very angry and said , “ Are  we all to suffer death for the sake of a girl ? We swear that we will  avenge ourselves!—wheresoever we find a girl , her red blood shall  flow . ”  Thereupon they went deeper into the forest , and in the midst of it ,  where it was the darkest , they found a little bewitched hut , which was  standing empty . Then said they , “ Here we will dwell , and thou Benjamin ,  who art the youngest and weakest , thou shalt stay at home and keep  house , we others will go out and get food . ” Then they went into the  forest and shot hares , wild deer , birds and pigeons , and whatsoever  there was to eat ; this they took to Benjamin , who had to dress it for  them in order that they might appease their hunger . They lived together  ten years in the little hut , and the time did not appear long to them .  The little daughter which their mother the Queen had given birth to ,  was now grown up ; she was good of heart , and fair of face , and had a  golden star on her forehead . Once , when it was the great washing , she  saw twelve men ’s shirts among the things , and asked her mother , “ To  whom do these twelve shirts belong , for they are far too small for  father ? ” Then the Queen answered with a heavy heart , “ Dear child , these  belong to thy twelve brothers . ” Said the maiden , “ Where are my twelve  brothers , I have never yet heard of them ? ” She replied , “ God knows  where they are , they are wandering about the world . ” Then she took the  maiden and opened the chamber for her , and showed her the twelve  coffins with the shavings , and pillows for

"<fairy> Only one  tune is played , and that tune never varies .
"	"I do n't know its real name ,  but the White Hussars call it , "" Take me to London again . "" It sounds very  pretty . The Regiment would sooner be struck off the roster than forego  their distinction .  After the "" dismiss "" was sounded , the officers rode off home to prepare for  stables ; and the men filed into the lines riding easy . That is to say ,  they opened their tight buttons , shifted their helmets , and began to joke  or to swear as the humor took them ; the more careful slipping off and  easing girths and curbs . A good trooper values his mount exactly as much  as he values himself , and believes , or should believe , that the two  together are irresistible where women or men , girls or guns , are  concerned .  Then the Orderly - Officer gave the order , "" Water horses , "" and the Regiment  loafed off to the squadron - troughs which were in rear of the stables and  between these and the barracks . There were four huge troughs , one for each  squadron , arranged _ en échelon _ , so that the whole Regiment could water in  ten minutes if it liked . But it lingered for seventeen , as a rule , while  the Band played .  The Band struck up as the squadrons filed off to the troughs , and the men  slipped their feet out of the stirrups and chaffed each other . The sun was  just setting in a big , hot bed of red cloud , and the road to the Civil  Lines seemed to run straight into the sun 's eye . There was a little dot on  the road . It grew and grew till it showed as a horse , with a sort of  gridiron - thing on his back . The red cloud glared through the bars of the  gridiron . Some of the troopers shaded their eyes with their hands and  said--""What the mischief ' as that there ' orse got on ' i m ? ""  In another minute they heard a neigh that every soul -- horse and man -- in  the Regiment knew , and saw , heading straight toward the Band , the dead  Drum - Horse of the White Hussars !  On his withers banged and bumped the kettledrums draped in crape , and on  his back , very stiff and soldierly , sat a bareheaded skeleton .  The Band stopped playing , and , for a moment , there was a hush .  Then some one in E Troop -- men said it was the Troop - Sergeant - Major -- swung  his horse round and yelled

"<fairy> ""  "" What ! "" said the man , "" I am only a poor weaver , and can you really  get me married to a King 's daughter ? ""  "" Yes , "" returned the jackal .
"	" So the weaver released it , and turning itself into a Brahmin , it  crossed the river and presented itself at the court of a certain Rajah ,  to whom it said : "" O King , I have found a rich weaver - caste Rajah ,  who wishes your daughter 's hand in marriage . ""  The Rajah , much pleased , consented , and the Brahmin , on getting outside  the Palace , once more turned into a jackal , and returned to the weaver .  "" Follow me , "" said he , "" and I will take you to the King 's daughter . ""  So the weaver took up his blanket , which was all he possessed .  On their way they met a Dhobie , or washerman , carrying his bundle  of clothes . The jackal gave him a gold mohur , and told him to spread  all the clean clothes he possessed upon the trees around .  Further on they met a cotton - beater , or man who , in the East , beats  cotton and prepares it to make up into pillows and quilts ; to him  they also gave a gold mohur , and asked in return for several large  balls of cotton .  These they carried on a large plate to the river ; and the jackal ,  leaving the weaver , returned as a Brahmin to the Rajah , who had seen  the Dhobie 's clothes in the distance , and thought they were tents  pitched by his daughter 's future husband .  The jackal had told the weaver to watch , and , as soon as he saw him  enter the Palace , he was to take large lumps of cotton and throw them  one by one into the river , so that they might be seen floating down  the stream .  "" The Bridegroom , "" explained the Brahmin , "" has met with a terrible  accident ; all his possessions and his followers are lost in the river ,  and only he and I remain , dressed in the clothes in which we stand . ""  Then the Rajah ordered his musicians and followers to come out , and  go with horses in great pomp to bring the weaver , who was forthwith  married to the Princess .  After the marriage the Brahmin said : "" This son - in - law of yours has  lost all he had ; what is the use of his returning to his country ? Let  him stay here with you .

"<fantasy> "" By God ! "" I would occasionally  say with Thackeray ; "" I _ am _ a genius ! ""  Besides , the story of the book , I knew , was novel and astutely wrought ;  its progress caught at once and teased your interest always , so that  having begun it , most people would read to the end , if only to discover  "" how it all came out .
"	""" I knew the book , in fine , could hardly fail to  please and interest a number of people by reason of its plot alone .  I ought to have been content with this . But I had somehow contracted an  insane notion that a novel is the more enjoyable when it is adroitly  written . In point of fact , of course , no man who writes with care is  ever read with pleasure ; you may toil through a page or two perhaps ,  but presently you are noting how precisely every word is fitted to the  thought , and later you are noting nothing else . You are insensibly  beguiled into a fidgety - footed analysis of every clause , which fatigues  in the outcome , and by the tenth page you are yawning .  But I did not comprehend this then . And so I fashioned my apt phrases ,  and weighed my synonyms , and echoed this or that vowel very skilfully ,  I thought , and alliterated my consonants with discretion . In fine , I  did not overlook the most meticulous device of the stylist ; and I  enjoyed it . It was a sort of game ; and they taught me at least , those  six delightful months , that a man writes admirable prose not at all for  the sake of having it read , but for the more sensible reason that he  enjoys playing solitaire .  I led a hermit 's life that winter ; and I enjoyed that too . Night , after  all , is the one time for writing , particularly when you are inane  enough to hanker after perfected speech , and so misguided as to be the  slave of the "" right word .

Then you dip into an Unabridged , and change every word that has been  written , for a better one , and do it leisurely , rolling in the mouth ,  as it were , the flavour of every possible synonym , before decision .

"	"On , on he galloped , leaving his retinue far behind ,  keeping the white hind in view , never drawing bridle until , finding  himself in a narrow ravine with no outlet , he reined in his steed .  Before him stood a miserable hovel , into which , being tired after his  long , unsuccessful chase , he entered to ask for a drink of water . An  old woman , seated in the hut at a spinning - wheel , answered his request  by calling to her daughter , and immediately from an inner room came  a maiden so lovely and charming , so white - skinned and golden - haired ,  that the King was transfixed by astonishment at seeing so beautiful a  sight in the wretched hovel .  She held the vessel of water to the King 's lips , and as he drank he  looked into her eyes , and then it became clear to him that the girl  was no other than the white hind with the golden horns and silver feet  he had chased so far .  Her beauty bewitched him , so he fell on his knees , begging her to  return with him as his bride ; but she only laughed , saying seven  Queens were quite enough even for a King to manage . However , when he  would take no refusal , but implored her to have pity on him , promising  her everything she could desire , she replied , "" Give me the eyes of  your seven Queens , and then perhaps I may believe you mean what you  say . ""  The King was so carried away by the glamor of the white hind 's magical  beauty that he went home at once , had the eyes of his seven Queens  taken out , and , after throwing the poor blind creatures into a noisome  dungeon whence they could not escape , set off once more for the hovel  in the ravine , bearing with him his horrible offering . But the  white hind only laughed cruelly when she saw the fourteen eyes ,  and threading them as a necklace , flung it round her mother 's neck ,  saying , "" Wear that , little mother , as a keepsake , while I am away in  the King 's palace . ""  Then she went back with the bewitched Monarch , as his bride , and he  gave her the seven Queens ' rich clothes and jewels to wear , the seven  Queens ' palace to live in , and the seven Queens ' slaves to wait upon  her ; so that she really had everything even a witch could desire .

Clement laughed and said : "" Not so fast , Lord Ralph ;  thou mayst yet hear a word or two . "" "" What ! "" said Ralph , "" hast thou  heard of something new ? "" Said Clement :   "" There has been a man here  seeking thee , who said that he wotted of a wise man who could tell thee  much concerning the Well at the World 's End .   And when I asked him of  the Damsel and the Lord of Utterbol , if he knew anything of her , he  said yea , but that he would keep it for thy privy ear .   So I bade him  go and come again when thou shouldst be here .   And I deem that he will  not tarry long .

"	" “ Did the illustrious individual who is now conferring distinction on  this really worn - out chair by occupying it express himself in favour of  having the face entirely denuded ? ” demanded the one who conducted the  operation ; for these persons have become famous for their elegant and  persistent ability to discourse , and frequently assume ignorance in  order that they themselves may make reply , and not for the purpose  of gaining knowledge . “ Now , in the objectionable opinion of this  unintelligent person , who has a presumptuous habit of offering his  very undesirable advice , a slight covering on the upper lip , delicately  arranged and somewhat fiercely pointed at the extremities , would  bestow an appearance of -- how shall this illiterate person explain  himself?--dignity?--matured reflexion?--doubtless the accomplished  nobleman before me will understand what is intended with a more  knife - like accuracy than this person can describe it -- but confer that  highly desirable effect upon the face of which at present it is entirely  destitute ... ‘ Entirely denuded ? ’ Then without fail it shall certainly be  so , O incomparable personage ... Does the versatile Mandarin now present  profess any concern as to the condition of the rice plants ? ... Indeed ,  the remark is an inspired one ; the subject is totally devoid of interest  to a person of intelligence ... A remarkable and gravity - removing event  transpired within the notice of this unassuming person recently . A  discriminating individual had purchased from him a portion of his justly  renowned Thrice - extracted Essence of Celestial Herb Oil -- a preparation  which in this experienced person ’s opinion , indeed , would greatly  relieve the undoubted afflictions from which the one before him is  evidently suffering -- when after once anointing himself-- ”  A lengthy period containing no words caused Ling , who had in the  meantime closed his eyes and lost Canton and all else in delicate  thoughts of Mian , to look up . That which met his attention on doing so  filled him with an intelligent wonder , for the person before him held in  his hand what had the appearance of a tuft of bright yellow hair , which  shone in the light of the sun with a most engaging splendour , but which  he nevertheless regarded with a most undignified expression of confusion  and awe .  “ Illustrious demon , ” he cried at length , kow - towing very respectfully ,  “ have the extreme amiableness to be of a benevolent disposition , and do  not take an unworthy and entirely unremunerative revenge upon this  very unimportant person for failing to detect and honour you from the  beginning . ”

"	"But both felt ill at ease . The friendly frankness was  disturbed , the sunshine had a shadow over it , and despite their  apparent gaiety , there was a secret discontent in the heart of each .  “ Shall we see you this evening , mon frere ? ” asked Amy , as they parted  at her aunt ’s door .  “ Unfortunately I have an engagement . Au revoir , madamoiselle , ” and  Laurie bent as if to kiss her hand , in the foreign fashion , which  became him better than many men . Something in his face made Amy say  quickly and warmly ...  “ No , be yourself with me , Laurie , and part in the good old way . I ’d  rather have a hearty English handshake than all the sentimental  salutations in France . ”  “ Goodbye , dear , ” and with these words , uttered in the tone she liked ,  Laurie left her , after a handshake almost painful in its heartiness .  Next morning , instead of the usual call , Amy received a note which made  her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end .  My Dear Mentor , Please make my adieux to your aunt , and exult within  yourself , for ‘ Lazy Laurence ’ has gone to his grandpa , like the best of  boys . A pleasant winter to you , and may the gods grant you a blissful  honeymoon at Valrosa ! I think Fred would be benefited by a rouser . Tell  him so , with my congratulations .  Yours gratefully , Telemachus  “ Good boy ! I ’m glad he ’s gone , ” said Amy , with an approving smile .

The words of acquiescence should  spring to meet your own , for the various branches of mendicancy are  languishing , and Yuen Yan can have no secret store of wealth . Do not  hesitate to offer a higher wage than you would as an affair of  ordinary commerce , for your safety depends upon it . Having secured  Yan , teach him quickly the unpolished outlines of your business and  then clothing him in robes similar to your own let him take his stand  within the shop and withdraw yourself to the inner chamber . None will  suspect the artifice , and Yuen Yan is manifestly incapable of  betraying it . Heng - cho , seeing him display himself openly , will not  deem it necessary to commit suicide yet , and , should he cut down Yan  fatally , the officials of the street will seize him and your own  safety will be assured . Finally , if nothing particular happens , at  least your prosperity will be increased , for Yuen Yan will prove  _ industrious _ , _ frugal _ , _ not addicted to excesses _ and in every way  _ reliable _ , and towards the shop of so exceptional a barber customers  will turn in an unending stream . ”  “ Alas ! ” exclaimed Chou - hu , “ when you boasted of an inspired scheme  this person for a moment foolishly allowed his mind to contemplate the  possibility of your having accidentally stumbled upon such an  expedient haply , but your suggestion is only comparable with a company  of ducks attempting to cross an ice - bound stream -- an excessive outlay  of action but no beneficial progress .

While one external cause , and that a reference to his long  lingering agony , would always -- as on the trial -- evoke this condition  from the depths of his soul , it was also in its nature to arise of  itself , and to draw a gloom over him , as incomprehensible to those  unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual  Bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun , when the substance was three  hundred miles away .  Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from  his mind . She was the golden thread that united him to a Past beyond his  misery , and to a Present beyond his misery : and the sound of her voice ,  the light of her face , the touch of her hand , had a strong beneficial  influence with him almost always . Not absolutely always , for she could  recall some occasions on which her power had failed ; but they were few  and slight , and she believed them over .  Mr. Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully , and had turned  to Mr. Stryver , whom he warmly thanked . Mr. Stryver , a man of little  more than thirty , but looking twenty years older than he was , stout ,  loud , red , bluff , and free from any drawback of delicacy , had a pushing  way of shouldering himself ( morally and physically ) into companies and  conversations , that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life .  He still had his wig and gown on , and he said , squaring himself at his  late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry clean  out of the group : “ I am glad to have brought you off with honour , Mr.  Darnay . It was an infamous prosecution , grossly infamous ; but not the  less likely to succeed on that account . ”  “ You have laid me under an obligation to you for life -- in two senses , ”   said his late client , taking his hand .  “ I have done my best for you , Mr. Darnay ; and my best is as good as  another man ’s , I believe . ”  It clearly being incumbent on some one to say , “ Much better , ” Mr. Lorry  said it ; perhaps

Dorothy picked them up and had the Winkies carry them back to the  castle , where they were stuffed with nice , clean straw ; and behold !  here was the Scarecrow , as good as ever , thanking them over and over  again for saving him .  Now that they were reunited , Dorothy and her friends spent a few happy  days at the Yellow Castle , where they found everything they needed to  make them comfortable .

The next day they called the Winkies together  and bade them good - bye . The Winkies were sorry to have them go , and  they had grown so fond of the Tin Woodman that they begged him to stay  and rule over them and the Yellow Land of the West . Finding they were  determined to go , the Winkies gave Toto and the Lion each a golden  collar ; and to Dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with  diamonds ; and to the Scarecrow they gave a gold - headed walking stick ,  to keep him from stumbling ; and to the Tin Woodman they offered a  silver oil - can , inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels .  Every one of the travelers made the Winkies a pretty speech in return ,  and all shook hands with them until their arms ached .

And by that I was come to the ending of  the thirty hours , I was sorely awearied , and gat me upward of the  monstrous cliff that did make the left side of the Gorge , having  perceived in a place a great ledge of the rock , that did seem very  proper for my purpose of slumber .  And when I was come upward upon the ledge of the rock , I saw that there  did seem something , like to a mighty spider , that did stay half without  of a hole in the back part of the ledge . And I smote the thing gently  with the Diskos , so that it was very quickly dead ; and afterward I  searched well about ; but did gladly perceive that there abode there no  other horrid creature .  And I eat two of the tablets , and drank some of the water ; and did  afterward make me ready for slumber , as ever . But now I did put the  cloak well about me ; for truly there was grown a chill into the air of  the Gorge ; and here also will I tell how that it did seem unto me that  the air was gone something from that great thickness and strength which  had been with me in the past days of my journeying .  Now I was gone so tired , that I fell upon sleep in a moment , yet with a  dear thought and anxious , concerning Naani ; but was so starved of the  body for slumber , that even mine anxiousness kept me not awake .

And they showed the wayfarers their manner of hunting , both of the hart  and the boar , and of wild bulls also .   At first Ralph somewhat loathed  all this ( though he kept a pleasant countenance toward his host ) , for  sorely he desired the fields of Upmeads and his father 's house .   But at  last when the hunt was up in the mountains , and especially of the wild  bulls , the heart and the might in him so arose that he enforced himself  to do well , and the wild men wondered at his prowess , whereas he was  untried in this manner of sports , and they deemed him one of the Gods ,  and said that their kinsman had done well to get him so good a friend .  Both Ursula and the Sage withheld them from this hunting , and Ursula  abode with the women , who told her much of their ways of life , and  stories of old time ; frank and free they were , and loved her much , and  she was fain of such manly - minded women after the sleight and lies of  the poor thralls of Utterbol .

On this journey naught befell to tell of , and  they all came down safe into the plain .  There the Goldburg men took their wage , and bidding farewell , turned  back with the wild men , praising Ralph much for his frankness and open  hand .   As for the wild men , they exceeded in their sorrow for the  parting , and many of them wept and howled as though they had seen him  die before their faces .

"" she said severely , rapping upon the desk .  "" Silence at once ! ""  And she began from that minute to feel rather a grudge against her show  pupil .  3  Ermengarde  On that first morning , when Sara sat at Miss Minchin 's side , aware that  the whole schoolroom was devoting itself to observing her , she had  noticed very soon one little girl , about her own age , who looked at her  very hard with a pair of light , rather dull , blue eyes .   She was a fat  child who did not look as if she were in the least clever , but she had  a good - naturedly pouting mouth . Her flaxen hair was braided in a tight  pigtail , tied with a ribbon , and she had pulled this pigtail around her  neck , and was biting the end of the ribbon , resting her elbows on the  desk , as she stared wonderingly at the new pupil .   When Monsieur  Dufarge began to speak to Sara , she looked a little frightened ; and  when Sara stepped forward and , looking at him with the innocent ,  appealing eyes , answered him , without any warning , in French , the fat  little girl gave a startled jump , and grew quite red in her awed  amazement . Having wept hopeless tears for weeks in her efforts to  remember that "" la mere "" meant "" the mother , "" and "" le pere , "" "" the  father,""--when one spoke sensible English -- it was almost too much for  her suddenly to find herself listening to a child her own age who  seemed not only quite familiar with these words , but apparently knew  any number of others , and could mix them up with verbs as if they were  mere trifles .  She stared so hard and bit the ribbon on her pigtail so fast that she  attracted the attention of Miss Minchin , who , feeling extremely cross  at the moment , immediately pounced upon her .  "" Miss St. John ! "" she exclaimed severely .   "" What do you mean by such  conduct ?   Remove your elbows !   Take your ribbon out of your mouth ! Sit  up at once ! ""  Upon which Miss St. John gave another jump , and when Lavinia and Jessie  tittered she became redder than ever -- so red , indeed , that she almost  looked as if tears were coming into

"	"She has carried off more  than one Prince like this , and she will certainly have anything she  takes a fancy to . ” While she was thus pretending to be sorry for the  King , he suddenly noticed her feet , which were like those of a griffin ,  and knew in a moment that this must be the Fairy of the Desert , for her  feet were the one thing she could not change , however pretty she might  make her face .  Without seeming to have noticed anything , he said , in a confidential  way :  “ Not that I have any dislike to the Fairy of the Desert , but I really  can not endure the way in which she protects the Yellow Dwarf and keeps  me chained here like a criminal . It is true that I love a charming  princess , but if the Fairy should set me free my gratitude would oblige  me to love her only . ”  “ Do you really mean what you say , Prince ? ” said the Fairy , quite  deceived .  “ Surely , ” replied the Prince ; “ how could I deceive you ? You see it is  so much more flattering to my vanity to be loved by a fairy than by  a simple princess . But , even if I am dying of love for her , I shall  pretend to hate her until I am set free . ”  The Fairy of the Desert , quite taken in by these words , resolved at once  to transport the Prince to a pleasanter place . So , making him mount  her chariot , to which she had harnessed swans instead of the bats which  generally drew it , away she flew with him . But imagine the distress  of the Prince when , from the giddy height at which they were rushing  through the air , he saw his beloved Princess in a castle built of  polished steel , the walls of which reflected the sun ’s rays so  hotly that no one could approach it without being burnt to a cinder !  Bellissima was sitting in a little thicket by a brook , leaning her head  upon her hand and weeping bitterly , but just as they passed she looked  up and saw the King and the Fairy of the Desert . Now , the Fairy was so  clever that she could not only seem beautiful to the King , but even the  poor Princess thought her the most lovely being she had ever seen .  “ What ! ” she cried ; “ was I not unhappy enough in this lonely castle to  which that frightful Yellow Dwarf brought me ? Must I also be

And these were an aged , hoary - headed man and a woman advanced  in years , and a fair young maiden , clad in worn - out garments .   And it was  for the avouchment of the love of that maiden that Geraint jousted for  the Sparrow - Hawk at the tournament ; for he said that that maiden was  better entitled to the Sparrow - Hawk than this maiden who was with me .   And  thereupon we encountered each other , and he left me , Lady , as thou  seest . ""   "" Sir , "" said she , "" when thinkest thou that Geraint will be here ?

It ’s madness . And where did the dream come from ? … I  must look at that machine .

There in the flickering light  of the lamp was the machine sure enough , squat , ugly , and askew , a  thing of brass , ebony , ivory , and translucent glimmering quartz . Solid  to the touch — for I put out my hand and felt the rail of it — and with  brown spots and smears upon the ivory , and bits of grass and moss upon  the lower parts , and one rail bent awry .  The Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench , and ran his hand  along the damaged rail . “ It ’s all right now , ” he said . “ The story I  told you was true . I ’m sorry to have brought you out here in the cold . ”  He took up the lamp , and , in an absolute silence , we returned to the  smoking - room .  He came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his coat .  The Medical Man looked into his face and , with a certain hesitation ,  told him he was suffering from overwork , at which he laughed hugely . I  remember him standing in the open doorway , bawling good - night .  I shared a cab with the Editor . He thought the tale a “ gaudy lie . ” For  my own part I was unable to come to a conclusion . The story was so  fantastic and incredible , the telling so credible and sober . I lay  awake most of the night thinking about it . I determined to go next day  and see the Time Traveller again .

"	" “ How nice ! But I wish she ’d let us have them now . Procrastination is  not agreeable , ” observed Amy , taking a last look at the diamonds .  “ It is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things . The  first one who is affianced will have the pearls , Madame has said it ,  and I have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you  when you go , for Madame approves your good behavior and charming  manners . ”  “ Do you think so ? Oh , I ’ll be a lamb , if I can only have that lovely  ring ! It ’s ever so much prettier than Kitty Bryant ’s . I do like Aunt  March after all . ” And Amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face  and a firm resolve to earn it .  From that day she was a model of obedience , and the old lady  complacently admired the success of her training . Esther fitted up the  closet with a little table , placed a footstool before it , and over it a  picture taken from one of the shut - up rooms . She thought it was of no  great value , but , being appropriate , she borrowed it , well knowing that  Madame would never know it , nor care if she did . It was , however , a  very valuable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world , and  Amy ’s beauty - loving eyes were never tired of looking up at the sweet  face of the Divine Mother , while her tender thoughts of her own were  busy at her heart . On the table she laid her little testament and  hymnbook , kept a vase always full of the best flowers Laurie brought  her , and came every day to ‘ sit alone ’ thinking good thoughts , and  praying the dear God to preserve her sister . Esther had given her a  rosary of black beads with a silver cross , but Amy hung it up and did  not use it , feeling doubtful as to its fitness for Protestant prayers .  The little girl was very sincere in all this , for being left alone  outside the safe home nest , she felt the need of some kind hand to hold  by so sorely that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender  Friend , whose fatherly love most closely surrounds His little children .  She missed her mother ’s help to understand and rule herself , but having  been taught where to look , she did her best to find the way and walk in  it confidingly . But ,

"<fantasy>  And a thousand times did I perceive things that had life ; and I made a  very cautious way ; though with a great speed and cleverness of going  that made my heart glad .
"	" And oft did I come to parts where a great life held the trees , and green  stuff did flourish exceedingly , and the air rich and full and wondrous  sweet ; so that I was fain to think how that in some far - off time , it  might be that our children 's children should come down unto this  Country , when the Upper Valley of the Night Land was grown to an utter  chill and lacking of air ; and here build them a new Refuge , if , indeed  any should come clear of the Evil Forces and the Monsters that did live  about the Mighty Pyramid in the Night Land . Yet , how should they come  clear of those things ; so that this is , as you do perceive , no more than  a thought that did rise vaguely in me . And yet , again , who shall say  what may be ?  And onward I did pass , and I do mind me how that I saw the lower fires  of that Country to burn very fierce ; and this I set to the richness of  the air ; but yet with no surety of knowledge ; and do but tell the same  that you shall see the oddments of thought that went oft across my  brain , and so have so much knowledge as I , concerning this and that .  Now , a little before the eighteenth hour was come , I came out from among  the trees , and the sea was downward of a great cliff unto my right , for  I had gone upward for a long and weary hour . And I did see now a thing  that made me to be cautious , and yet that did hold my heart to go  swiftly to perceive the thing ; for it was very strange .  And I went forward quickly , yet with a wise care ; and so was come  presently more nigh . And I perceived that the thing was , in part , a high  rock , very tall and pointed and maybe an hundred feet high ; but  afterward I did find it to be more . And there was a monstrous great  thing upon the top of the rock , that did seem very strange ; and I stopt  and lookt , and afterward went forward again ; and so for a time , until  that I was but a little way off .

"<fairy>  It would seem that a few personal remarks about George Washington at  this point might not be out of place .
"	"Later on his part in this history  will more fully appear .  The author points with some pride to a study of Washington 's great act  in crossing the Delaware , from a wax - work of great accuracy . The reader  will avoid confusing Washington with the author , who is dressed in a  plaid suit and on the shore , while Washington may be seen in this end of  the boat with the air of one who has just discovered the location of a  glue - factory on the side of the river .  A directory of Washington 's head - quarters has been arranged by the  author of this book , and at a reunion of the general 's body - servants to  be held in the future the work will be on sale .  The name of George Washington has always had about it a glamour that  made him appear more in the light of a god than a tall man with large  feet and a mouth made to fit an old - fashioned full - dress pumpkin pie .  George Washington 's face has beamed out upon us for many years now , on  postage - stamps and currency , in marble and plaster and in bronze , in  photographs of original portraits , paintings , and stereoscopic views . We  have seen him on horseback and on foot , on the war - path and on skates ,  playing the flute , cussing his troops for their shiftlessness , and then ,  in the solitude of the forest , with his snorting war - horse tied to a  tree , engaged in prayer .  We have seen all these pictures of George , till we are led to believe  that he did not breathe our air or eat American groceries . But George  Washington was not perfect . I say this after a long and careful study of  his life , and I do not say it to detract the very smallest iota from the  proud history of the Father of his Country . I say it simply that the  boys of America who want to become George Washingtons will not feel so  timid about trying it .  When I say that George Washington , who now lies so calmly in the  lime - kiln at Mount Vernon , could reprimand and reproach his  subordinates , at times , in a way to make the ground crack open and  break up the ice in the Delaware a week earlier than usual , I do not  mention it in order to show the boys of our day that profanity will make  them resemble George Washington . That was one of his weak points , and no  doubt he was ashamed of

"<fairy> Mrs. Jennings ,  however , with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her ,  declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as  Marianne remained ill , and of endeavouring , by her own attentive care ,  to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from ; and  Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate ,  desirous to share in all her fatigues , and often by her better  experience in nursing , of material use .
"	" Poor Marianne , languid and low from the nature of her malady , and  feeling herself universally ill , could no longer hope that tomorrow  would find her recovered ; and the idea of what tomorrow would have  produced , but for this unlucky illness , made every ailment severe ; for  on that day they were to have begun their journey home ; and , attended  the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings , were to have taken their  mother by surprise on the following forenoon . The little she said was  all in lamentation of this inevitable delay ; though Elinor tried to  raise her spirits , and make her believe , as she _ then _ really believed  herself , that it would be a very short one .  The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the  patient ; she certainly was not better , and , except that there was no  amendment , did not appear worse . Their party was now farther reduced ;  for Mr. Palmer , though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity  and good - nature , as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away  by his wife , was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his  promise of following her ; and while he was preparing to go , Colonel  Brandon himself , with a much greater exertion , began to talk of going  likewise.—Here , however , the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most  acceptably ; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much  uneasiness on her sister ’s account , would be to deprive them both , she  thought , of every comfort ; and therefore telling him at once that his  stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself , that she should want him to  play at piquet of an evening , while Miss Dashwood was above with her  sister , & c. she urged him so strongly to remain , that he , who was  gratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance , could not  long even affect to demur ; especially as Mrs. Jennings ’s entreaty was  warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer , who seemed to feel a relief to himself ,  in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise Miss  Dashwood in any emergence .  Marianne was , of course , kept in ignorance of all these arrangements .  She knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of  Cleveland away , in about seven days from the time of their arrival . It  gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer ; and as it

There , in the warm litter  above the melons , very cunningly hidden , he found twenty - five eggs ,  about the size of a bantam ’s eggs , but with whitish skin instead of  shell .  “ I was not a day too soon , ” he said , for he could see the baby cobras  curled up inside the skin , and he knew that the minute they were hatched  they could each kill a man or a mongoose . He bit off the tops of the  eggs as fast as he could , taking care to crush the young cobras , and  turned over the litter from time to time to see whether he had missed  any . At last there were only three eggs left , and Rikki - tikki began to  chuckle to himself , when he heard Darzee ’s wife screaming :  “ Rikki - tikki , I led Nagaina toward the house , and she has gone into the  veranda , and -- oh , come quickly -- she means killing ! ”  Rikki - tikki smashed two eggs , and tumbled backward down the melon - bed  with the third egg in his mouth , and scuttled to the veranda as hard as  he could put foot to the ground . Teddy and his mother and father were  there at early breakfast , but Rikki - tikki saw that they were not eating  anything . They sat stone - still , and their faces were white . Nagaina was  coiled up on the matting by Teddy ’s chair , within easy striking distance  of Teddy ’s bare leg , and she was swaying to and fro , singing a song of  triumph .  “ Son of the big man that killed Nag , ” she hissed , “ stay still . I am not  ready yet . Wait a little . Keep very still , all you three ! If you move I  strike , and if you do not move I strike . Oh , foolish people , who killed  my Nag ! ”  Teddy ’s eyes were fixed on his father , and all his father could do was  to whisper , “ Sit still , Teddy . You must n’t move .

Grandmother 's face was radiant with satisfaction , as the wave of  joyousness crept up higher and higher round her , till the elders , who  stood keeping time with their heads and feet , began to tell one another  how they had danced with their sweethearts in good old days gone by ,  and the elder women began to blush and bridle , and boast of steps that  they could take in their youth , till the music finally subdued them ,  and into the dance they went .

And so they abided the issue .  CHAPTER XVI -- HOW THE DWARF - WROUGHT HAUBERK WAS BROUGHT AWAY FROM THE HALL  OF THE DAYLINGS  Now it must be told that early in the morning , after the night when Gisli  had brought to the Wolfing Stead the tidings of the Battle in the Wood , a  man came riding from the south to the Dayling abode .   It was just before  sunrise , and but few folk were stirring about the dwellings .   He rode up  to the Hall and got off his black horse , and tied it to a ring in the  wall by the Man's - door , and went in clashing , for he was in his battle-  gear , and had a great wide - rimmed helm on his head .  Folk were but just astir in the Hall , and there came an old woman to him ,  and looked on him and saw by his attire that he was a man of the Goths  and of the Wolfing kindred ; so she greeted him kindly : but he said :  "" Mother , I am come hither on an errand , and time presses . ""  Said she : "" Yea , my son , or what tidings bearest thou from the south ? for  by seeming thou art new - come from the host . ""  Said he : "" The tidings are as yesterday , save that Thiodolf will lead the  host through the wild - wood to look for the Romans beyond it : therefore  will there soon be battle again .   See ye , Mother , hast thou here one that  knoweth this ring of Thiodolf 's , if perchance men doubt

"<fantasy> So she gathered heart again , and presently  turned her hand once more to stripping her raiment off her , for she  would not be baulked of her bath ; but when the stripping was done ,  she loitered not naked on the bank as she had done the day before , but  walked swiftly into the shallow , and thence down into the pool , till  nothing but her head and the whiteness of her shoulders showed over the  dark water .
"	"Even then she turned her head about twice to look into the  over - side bushes , but when she saw nothing stir there she began to play  in the water , but not for long , but came splashing through the shallow  and hurried on her raiment .  When she was clad again she went up to the horse , and patted and  caressed him , and did bridle and saddle on him , and was going to climb  upon him , when , of a sudden , she thought she would lead him across , lest  there should be a hole near the other bank and he might stumble into  it unwarily ; so she bared her feet once more and trussed up her gown  skirts , and so took the ford , leading the beast ; the water was nowhere  up to mid - leg of her , and she stepped ashore on to short and fine grass ,  which spread like a meadow before her , with a big thorn or two scattered  about it , and a little grassy hill beset with tall elms toward the top ,  coming down into the flat of the meadow and drawing round it nearly up  to the river on the north side .  But now she stood staring in wonder and some deal of fear ; for there  were three milch kine feeding on the meadow , and , moreover , under a  thorn , scarce a hundred yards from where she stood , was a tall man  standing gazing on her . So stricken was she that she might neither cry  out nor turn aside ; neither did she think to pull her gown out of her  girdle to cover the nakedness of her legs .  When they had thus stood a little while the man began to move toward  her very slowly , nor did she dare to flee any the more . But when he was  within half a dozen paces her face flushed red , and she did pull her  gown out of its trusses and let it flow down . But he spake to her in a  pleasant voice , and said : "" May I speak to thee , maiden ? ""  Fear was yet in her soul , so that she might not speak for a little , and  then she said : "" O , I beseech thee , bring me not back to Greenharbour ! ""  And she paled sorely as she spake the word .  But he said : "" I wot not of Greenharbour , how to find the way thereto ,  though we have heard of it . But comfort thyself , I pray thee , there is  nought to fear in me . ""

Yet , though the voice was the voice of Mirdath the Beautiful , it  was also the voice of Naani ; and I knew in all my heart that this thing  was in verity ; and that it had been given to me to be birthed once more  into this world in the living - time of that Only One , with whom my spirit  and essence hath mated in all ages through the everlasting . And I called  with my brain - elements and all my strength to Naani ; but there came no  answer ; neither sign of hearing , though through hours I called .  And thus at last I came to an utter exhaustion ; but neither could be  quiet , nor sleep . Yet , presently , I slept .  And when I waked , my first memory was of the wondrous thing which had  befallen in the sleep - time ; for none in all this world could have known  those words ; save it had been the spirit of Mirdath , my Beautiful One ,  looking from above my shoulder in that utter - lost time , as I made those  words to her , out of an aching and a broken heart .

And immediately I called to Naani , once , and again twice ; and in a  little moment there came all about me the throbbing of the Master - Word ,  beating solemnly in the night ; and I sent the Master - Word to give  assurance , and immediately the voice of Naani , a little weak as was it  always when she had not the Instrument , but sent the message with her  brain - elements .  And I answered her , and questioned her eagerly concerning her sayings of  the past time of sleep ; but she disclaimed , and made clear to me that  she had no knowledge of having spoken ; but had slept through all that  time of which I made to tell ; and , indeed , had dreamed a very strange  dream .

"<fantasy> But my kinsman Thorgeir I deem  knows not how to fear .
"	"""  "" Yea , so it is with their minds as thou sayest , "" said Skapti ; and with  that they left talking .  Now , at this Althing Thorod Drapa - Stump brought forward a suit for the  slaying of Thorbiorn Oxmain , which he had not brought to a hearing at  the Hunawater Thing , because of the kin of Atli , and he deemed that  here his case would be less like to be thrown over . The kinsmen of  Atli sought counsel of Skapti about the case ; and he said he saw in  it a lawful defence , so that full atonement would be forthcoming  therefor . Then were these matters laid unto umpiredom , and most men  were minded that the slayings of Atli and Thorbiorn should be set one  against the other .  But when Skapti knew that , he went to the judges , and asked whence  they had that ? They said that they deemed the slain men were bonders  of equal worth .  Then Skapti asked , which was the first , the outlawry of Grettir or  the slaying of Atli ? So , when that was reckoned up , there was a week 's  space betwixt Grettir 's outlawry at the Althing and the slaying of  Atli , which befell just after it .  Then said Skapti , "" Thereof my mind misgave me , that ye had made an  oversight in setting on foot the suit in that ye made him a suitor ,  who was outlawed already , and could neither defend nor prosecute his  own case . Now I say that Grettir has nought to do with the case of the  slaying , but let him take up the blood - suit , who is nighest of kin by  law . ""  Then said Thorod Drapa - Stump , "" And who shall answer for the slaying of  Thorbiorn my brother ? ""  "" See ye to that for yourselves , "" said Skapti ; "" but the kin of Grettir  will never pour out fee for him or his works , if no peace is to be  bought for him . ""  Now when Thorvald Asgeirson was aware that Grettir was set aside from  following the blood - suit , he and his sought concerning who was the  next of kin ; and that turned out to be Skeggi , son of Gamli of  Meals , and Uspak , son of Glum of Ere in Bitra ; they were both of them  exceeding zealous and pushing .  Now must Thorod give atonement for Atli 's slaying , and two hundreds in  silver he had to pay .  Then spake Snorri the Godi , "" Will ye now

"	""" And the King of Shadow Valley passed into the  deeps of the wood .  As the great gates were slowly swinging to , Don Alderon came back  thoughtfully . The gates clanged , clicked , and were shut again . The King  of Shadow Valley and all his bowmen were gone .  Don Alderon went to his horse , and Rodriguez and Morano did the same ,  drawn by the act of the only man of the three that seemed to have made  up his mind . Don Alderon led his horse back toward the path , and  Rodriguez followed with his . When they came to the path they mounted in  silence ; and presently Morano followed them , with his blankets rolled  up in front of him on his horse and his frying - pan slung behind him .  "" Which way ? "" said Rodriguez .  "" Home , "" said Don Alderon .  "" But I can not go to your home , "" said Rodriguez .  "" Come , "" said Don Alderon , as one whose plans were made . Rodriguez  without a home , without plans , without hope , went with Don Alderon as  thistledown goes with the warm wind . They rode through the forest till  it grew all so dim that only a faint tinge of greenness lay on the dark  leaves : above were patches of bluish sky like broken pieces of steel .  And a star or two were out when they left the forest . And cantering on  they came to Lowlight when the Milky Way appeared .  And there were Dona Mirana and Serafina in the hall to greet them as  they entered the door .  "" What news ? "" they asked .  But Rodriguez hung back ; he had no news to give . It was Don Alderon  that went forward , speaking cheerily to Serafina , and afterwards to his  mother , with whom he spoke long and anxiously , pointing toward the  forest sometimes , almost , as Rodriguez thought , in fear .  And a little later , when the ladies had retired , Don Alderon told  Rodriguez over the wine , with which he had tried to cheer his forlorn  companion , that it was arranged that he should marry Serafina . And when  Rodriguez lamented that this was impossible he replied that the King of  Shadow Valley wished it . And when Rodriguez heard this his astonishment  equalled his happiness , for he marvelled that Don Alderon should not  only believe that strange man 's unsupported promise , but that he should  even obey him as though he held him in awe .  And on the next day Rodriguez spoke with Dona

"<fairy> In this cave a  son was born to her , who proved to be a monster of hideous aspect ,  having the form of a snake and the characteristics of a vampire ,  who could be appeased only when fed with human blood .
"	"This monster  they called U Thlen .  Unlike his mother , U Thlen could not transform himself into any  likeness but that of a snake , but he had power to diminish or to  enlarge his size at will . Sometimes he appeared so small as to be  no bigger than a string of fine thread , at other times he expanded  himself to such dimensions that he could swallow a man bodily .  In those days there was much intercourse between the Bleis and  mankind . The latter were privileged to attend the Iew - blei -- the fair of  the Bleis -- at Lynghingkhongkhen , the way to which passed the Pomdoloi  cave , and many unwary and unprotected travellers fell a prey to the  greed of U Thlen and his associates .  The commonest mode by which these poor unfortunates were lured to their  doom was through the blandishments of Ka Kma Kharai , who approached  them in the form of a woman merchant , and dazzled them with the  brilliancy of the jewelry she offered for sale . She refrained from  killing her captives on occasions , but induced them by promises of  riches and immunity to pledge themselves to the services of U Thlen ,  her son . To such as these she gave a magic ring , known in ancient lore  as the Yngkuid Ring ( Sati Yngkuid ) which was believed to possess magic  that enabled the owners of the ring to obtain all the desires of their  hearts , but this magic was dormant until the owners fulfilled their  obligations to U Thlen and brought him human victims to feed upon .  The method by which U Yak Jakor captured his victims was to waylay  lonely travellers and to club them to death . U Thlen himself , when  he grew old enough , also hunted men to death , so that between the  three murderers the ravages made upon mankind were becoming grievous  and intolerable .  Mankind sought divinations and offered sacrifices to the gods for the  cessation of these atrocities , upon which a Durbar of the Bleis was  called . U Mawlong Siem , who was a powerful Blei and a blood - relation  of the murderers , overruled the Durbar , declaring that no authority  could deprive the Bleis , or the demons , of any power they possessed ,  be it for good or for evil ; but to mitigate the distress of mankind  a decree was issued , restricting the number of people to be devoured  to half the number of captives . If U Thlen captured two victims , one  was to be released , if he captured ten , five were to be released . It  transpired

"<fairy>  In a morning ’s excursion to Exeter , they had met with two young ladies ,  whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be her  relations , and this was enough for Sir John to invite them directly to  the park , as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over .
"	" Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such an  invitation , and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on the  return of Sir John , by hearing that she was very soon to receive a  visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life , and of whose  elegance,—whose tolerable gentility even , she could have no proof ; for  the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for  nothing at all . Their being her relations too made it so much the  worse ; and Mrs. Jennings ’s attempts at consolation were therefore  unfortunately founded , when she advised her daughter not to care about  their being so fashionable ; because they were all cousins and must put  up with one another . As it was impossible , however , now to prevent  their coming , Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it , with  all the philosophy of a well - bred woman , contenting herself with merely  giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six times  every day .  The young ladies arrived : their appearance was by no means ungenteel or  unfashionable . Their dress was very smart , their manners very civil ,  they were delighted with the house , and in raptures with the furniture ,  and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that Lady  Middleton ’s good opinion was engaged in their favour before they had  been an hour at the Park . She declared them to be very agreeable girls  indeed , which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration . Sir John ’s  confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise , and he  set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss  Steeles ’ arrival , and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls  in the world . From such commendation as this , however , there was not  much to be learned ; Elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in the  world were to be met with in every part of England , under every  possible variation of form , face , temper and understanding . Sir John  wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at his  guests . Benevolent , philanthropic man ! It was painful to him even to  keep a third cousin to himself .  “ Do come now , ” said he—“pray come — you must come — I declare you shall  come — You ca n’t think how you will like them .

"	"I believe you are attempting to bribe me into conniving at  his escape . I shall do nothing of the sort , because , in the first  place , it would be an abominable violation of my oath of office , and in  the second place , it would result in my being hanged .

I do not  believe you ever saw this Comte de la Forêt . I very certainly do not  believe you are a friend of this Comte de la Forêt 's , because in  that event you would never have been mad enough to admit it . The  statement is enough to hang you twice over . In short , the only thing I  can be certain of is that you are out of your wits .

There is a wisdom lies beyond the moon , and it is because  of this that the stars are glad and admirable .

You will remember that this same  fidelity has touched me to such an extent that I am granting you an  interview with your former master . Messire de la Forêt will naturally  reflect that a man once torn in four pieces has no particular use for  emeralds . He will , I repeat , be moved .

I do really aspect you 'll have to  get me a clean dress to put on . ""  She held up her frock , and the dwarf looked at it anxiously . It was  certainly very dirty . The front was entirely covered with mud , and  matters had not been improved by her scrubbing it with leaves that she  pulled off the trees as they came along .  "" Dear me , Snow - white ! "" said the dwarf . "" That is pretty bad , is n't it ? ""  "" Yes , "" said the child ; "" it is _ too _ bad ! You 'll have to get me another .  What kind will you get ? ""  "" Well , "" said the dwarf , slowly ; "" you see -- I hardly -- wait a minute ,  Snow - white . ""  He went into the house , and the child waited cheerfully , sitting in  the root - seat . Of course he would find a dress ; he had all the other  things , and most prob'ly likely there was a box that had dresses and  things in it . She hoped it would be blue , because she was tired of this  pink one . There might be a hat , too ; when you had that kind of box , it  was just as easy to have everything as only something ; a pink velvet  hat with white feathers , like the lady in the circus . The child sighed  comfortably , and folded her hands , and watched the robins pulling up  worms on the green .  But the dwarf went into the bedroom , and began pulling out drawers and  opening chests with a perplexed air . Piles of handkerchiefs , socks ,  underwear , all of the finest and best ; gray suits like the one he had  on -- but never a sign of a blue dress . He took down a dressing - gown from  a peg , and looked it over anxiously ; it was of brown velvet , soft and  comfortable - looking , but it had evidently been lived in a good deal ,  and it smelt of smoke ; no , that would never do . He hung it up again ,  and looked about him helplessly .  Suddenly his brow cleared , and his eyes darkened . He laughed ; not  his usual melodious chuckle , but the short harsh note that the child  compared to a bark .  ""

In two hours time we shall be past all peril of my people , and when we  come down below I will slay thee as many as thou wilt , so it be out of  the kindred .   Forsooth down there evil they be , and unkinsome .

But now the fellowship took to riding so fast down the slopes of the  mountains on a far better road , that talking together was not easy .  They kept good watch , both behind and ahead , nor were they set upon  again , though whiles they saw clumps of men on the hill - sides .  So after a while , when it was a little past noon , they came adown to  the lower slopes of the mountains and the foot - hills , which were green  and unstony ; and thereon were to be seen cattle and neatherds and  shepherds , and here and there the garth of a homestead , and fenced  acres about it .  So now that they were come down into the peopled parts , they displayed  the banners of their fellowships , to wit , the Agnes , the White Fleece ,  the Christopher , and the Ship and Nicholas , which last was the banner  of the Faring - knights of Whitwall ; but Ralph was glad to ride under the  banner of St. Nicholas , his friend , and deemed that luck might the  rather come to him thereby .   But they displayed their banners now ,  because they knew that no man of the peopled parts would be so hardy as  to fall upon the Chapmen , of whom they looked to have many matters for  their use and pleasure .  So now that they felt themselves safe , they stayed them , and sat down  by a fair little stream , and ate their dinner of such meat and drink as  they had ; and Ralph departed his share with his thrall , and the man was  hungry and ate well ; so that Clement said mockingly : ""

"<fantasy>  The other of the two persons was Hien , a youth of studious desires and  unassuming manner .
"	"His father had been the chief tax - collector of the  Chunling mountains , beyond the town , and although the exact nature of  the tax and the reason for its extortion had become forgotten in the  process of interminable ages , he himself never admitted any doubt of  his duty to collect it from all who passed over the mountains , even  though the disturbed state of the country made it impossible for him  to transmit the proceeds to the capital . To those who uncharitably  extended the envenomed tongue of suspicion towards the very existence  of any Imperial tax , the father of Hien replied with unshaken loyalty  that in such a case the sublime Emperor had been very treacherously  served by his advisers , as the difficulty of the paths and the  intricate nature of the passes rendered the spot peculiarly suitable  for the purpose , and as he was accompanied by a well - armed and  somewhat impetuous band of followers , his arguments were inevitably  successful . When he Passed Beyond , Hien accepted the leadership , but  solely out of a conscientious respect for his father ’s memory , for his  heart was never really in the occupation . His time was almost wholly  taken up in reading the higher Classics , and even before he had seen  Fa Fei his determination had been taken that when once he had  succeeded in passing the examination for the second degree and thereby  become entitled to an inferior mandarinship he would abandon his  former life forever . From this resolution the entreaties of his  devoted followers could not shake him , and presently they ceased to  argue , being reassured by the fact that although Hien presented  himself unfailingly for every examination his name appeared at the  foot of each successive list with unvarying frequency . It was at this  period that he first came under the ennobling spell of Fa Fei ’s  influence and from that time forth he redoubled his virtuous efforts .  After conversing with her father , as already related , Fa Fei spent the  day in an unusually thoughtful spirit . As soon as it was dark she  stepped out from the house and veiling her purpose under the pretext  of gathering some herbs to complete a charm she presently entered a  grove of overhanging cedars where Hien had long been awaiting her  footsteps .  “ Rainbow of my prosaic existence ! ” he exclaimed , shaking hands with  himself courteously , “ have you yet carried out your bold suggestion ? ”   and so acute was his anxiety for her reply that he continued to hold  his hand unconsciously until Fa Fei turned away her face in very  becoming confusion .

"	" Now it was Baron Conrad ’s turn to be summoned to the Imperial Court ,  for complaint had been lodged against him by his old enemy of  Trutz - Drachen -- Baron Henry -- the nephew of the old Baron Frederick  who had been slain while kneeling in the dust of the road back of the  Kaiserburg .  No one at Drachenhausen could read but Master Rudolph , the steward ,  who was sand blind , and little Otto . So the boy read the summons to his  father , while the grim Baron sat silent with his chin resting upon his  clenched fist and his eyebrows drawn together into a thoughtful frown as  he gazed into the pale face of his son , who sat by the rude oaken table  with the great parchment spread out before him .  Should he answer the summons , or scorn it as he would have done under  the old emperors ? Baron Conrad knew not which to do ; pride said one  thing and policy another . The Emperor was a man with an iron hand , and  Baron Conrad knew what had happened to those who had refused to obey the  imperial commands . So at last he decided that he would go to the court ,  taking with him a suitable escort to support his dignity .  It was with nearly a hundred armed men clattering behind him that Baron  Conrad rode away to court to answer the imperial summons . The castle was  stripped of its fighting men , and only eight remained behind to guard  the great stone fortress and the little simple - witted boy .  It was a sad mistake .  Three days had passed since the Baron had left the castle , and now the  third night had come . The moon was hanging midway in the sky , white and  full , for it was barely past midnight .  The high precipitous banks of the rocky road threw a dense black shadow  into the gully below , and in that crooked inky line that scarred the  white face of the moonlit rocks a band of some thirty men were creeping  slowly and stealthily nearer and nearer to Castle Drachenhausen . At the  head of them was a tall , slender knight clad in light chain armor , his  head covered only by a steel cap or bascinet .  Along the shadow they crept , with only now and then a faint clink or  jingle of armor to break the stillness , for most of those who followed  the armed knight were clad in leathern jerkins ; only one or two wearing  even so much as a steel breast - plate by way of armor .  So at last

"	"Trot thought the argonauts  comical little creatures , with their big eyes and sharp noses , and  to her they looked like a fleet of tiny ships .  It is said that men got their first idea of boats and of how to sail  them from watching these little argonauts .  CHAPTER 10  THE UNDISCOVERED ISLAND  In following the fleet of argonauts , the four explorers had risen  higher in the water and soon found they had wandered to an open  space that seemed to Trot like the flat top of a high hill . The  sands were covered with a growth of weeds so gorgeously colored that  one who had never peered beneath the surface of the sea would  scarcely believe they were not the product of a dye shop . Every  known hue seemed represented in the delicate , fern - like leaves that  swayed softly to and fro as the current moved them . They were not  set close together , these branches of magnificent hues , but were  scattered sparsely over the sandy bottom of the sea so that while  from a distance they seemed thick , a nearer view found them spread  out with ample spaces of sand between them .  In these sandy spaces lay the real attractiveness of the place , for  here were many of those wonders of the deep that have surprised and  interested people in all ages .  First were the starfishes -- hundreds of them , it seemed -- lying  sleepily on the bottom , with their five or six points extended  outward . They were of various colors , some rich and brilliant ,  others of dark brown hues . A few had wound their arms around the  weeds or were creeping slowly from one place to another , in the  latter case turning their points downward and using them as legs .  But most of them were lying motionless , and as Trot looked down upon  them she thought they resembled stars in the sky on a bright night ,  except that the blue of the heavens was here replaced by the white  sand , and the twinkling diamond stars by the colored starfish .  "" We are near an island , "" said the Queen , "" and that is why so many  starfishes are here , as they love to keep close to shore . Also the  little seahorses love these weeds , and to me they are more  interesting than the starfish . ""  Trot now noticed the seahorses for the first time . They were quite  small -- merely two or three inches high -- but had funny little heads  that were shaped much like the head of a horse , and bright ,

And all the knights  whom Sir Gareth had overcome were at the feast ; and every manner of revels  and games was held with music and minstrelsy . And there was a great  jousting for three days . But because of his bride the king would not  suffer Sir Gareth to joust . Then did King Arthur give great lands and  fair , with store of gold , to Sir Gareth and his wife , that so they might  live royally together to their lives ' end .  CHAPTER XI  _ The Adventures of Sir Tristram of Lyonesse _  Again King Arthur held high festival at Caerleon , at Pentecost , and  gathered round him all the fellowship of the Round Table , and so ,  according to his custom , sat and waited till some adventure should arise ,  or some knight return to court whose deeds and perils might be told .  Anon he saw Sir Lancelot and a crowd of knights coming through the doors  and leading in their midst the mighty knight , Sir Tristram . As soon as  King Arthur saw him , he rose up and went through half the hall , and held  out both his hands and cried , "" Right welcome to thee , good Sir Tristram ,  as welcome art thou as any knight that ever came before into this court . A  long time have I wished for thee amongst my fellowship . "" Then all the  knights and barons rose up with one accord and came around , and cried out ,  "" Welcome . "" Queen Guinevere came also , and many ladies with her , and all  with one voice said the same .  Then the king took Sir Tristram by the hand and led him to the Round Table  and said , "" Welcome again for one of the best and gentlest knights in all  the world ; a chief in war , a chief in peace , a chief in field and forest ,  a chief in the ladies ' chamber -- right heartily welcome to this court , and  mayest thou long abide in it . ""  When he had so said he looked at every empty seat until he came to what  had been Sir Marhaus ' , and there he found written in gold letters , "" This  is the seat of the noble knight , Sir Tristram .

I turned and trudged for the gap in  the blue - grey mountains .  Already when I arrived some colour began to show in the amethyst  precipice below the gap although it was not yet morning .   I heard a  rattling and sometimes caught a flash from those golden dragons far  away below me that are the triumph of the goldsmiths of Sirdoo and  were given life by the ritual incantations of the conjurer Amargrarn .  On the edge of the opposite cliff , too near I thought for safety , I  saw the ivory palace of Singanee that mighty elephant - hunter ; small  lights appeared in windows , the slaves were awake , and beginning with  heavy eyelids the work of the day .  And now a ray of sunlight topped the world .   Others than I must  describe how it swept from the amethyst cliff the shadow of the black  one that opposed it , how that one shaft of sunlight pierced the  amethyst for leagues , and how the rejoicing colour leaped up to  welcome the light and shot back a purple glow on the walls of the  palace of ivory while down in that incredible ravine the golden  dragons still played in the darkness .  At this moment a female slave came out by a door of the palace and  tossed a basket - full of sapphires over the edge .   And when day was  manifest on those marvellous heights and the flare of the amethyst  precipice filled the abyss , then the elephant - hunter arose in his  ivory palace and took his terrific spear and going out by a landward  door went forth to avenge Perdóndaris  I turned then and looked upon the lands of Dream , and the thin white  mist that never rolls quite away was shifting in the morning .

And whether it to be the one way or the  other , you to know that where this Force or Spirit be found untainted ,  there is man ; and I to be not opposed to think that Man doth be constant  alway in matters of fundament , and neither to have been ever truly  different ; though something modified in the body and surely , in the  first , all undeveloped in the lovely things of the spirit , because that  there to be no call to these .

Yet , even did it be ever proved that Man once to be a  fish , I to have no cause to abate the first part of mine argument ; but  to have the more need of the thought , that I gain power to accept the  Fact ; for I still then to have no occasion that I think Man to have been  truly a Fish , or aught truly different from a Man ; but only that he did  be once Modified physically to his need , and to be still possessed of  the Man - Spirit , though all lackt of

"	" Mowgli , who had been trained under the Law of the Jungle , did not like  or understand this kind of life . The monkeys dragged him into the Cold  Lairs late in the afternoon , and instead of going to sleep , as Mowgli  would have done after a long journey , they joined hands and danced about  and sang their foolish songs . One of the monkeys made a speech and told  his companions that Mowgli ’s capture marked a new thing in the history  of the Bandar - log , for Mowgli was going to show them how to weave sticks  and canes together as a protection against rain and cold . Mowgli picked  up some creepers and began to work them in and out , and the monkeys  tried to imitate ; but in a very few minutes they lost interest and began  to pull their friends ’ tails or jump up and down on all fours , coughing .  “ I wish to eat , ” said Mowgli . “ I am a stranger in this part of the  jungle . Bring me food , or give me leave to hunt here . ”  Twenty or thirty monkeys bounded away to bring him nuts and wild  pawpaws . But they fell to fighting on the road , and it was too much  trouble to go back with what was left of the fruit . Mowgli was sore and  angry as well as hungry , and he roamed through the empty city giving the  Strangers ’ Hunting Call from time to time , but no one answered him , and  Mowgli felt that he had reached a very bad place indeed . “ All that Baloo  has said about the Bandar - log is true , ” he thought to himself . “ They  have no Law , no Hunting Call , and no leaders -- nothing but foolish words  and little picking thievish hands . So if I am starved or killed here ,  it will be all my own fault . But I must try to return to my own jungle .  Baloo will surely beat me , but that is better than chasing silly rose  leaves with the Bandar - log . ”  No sooner had he walked to the city wall than the monkeys pulled him  back , telling him that he did not know how happy he was , and pinching  him to make him grateful . He set his teeth and said nothing , but  went with the shouting monkeys to a terrace above the red sandstone  reservoirs that were half - full of rain water . There was a ruined  summer - house of white marble in the center of the terrace , built for  queens dead

"	"But  what was the horror of the Fairy , who followed this gay troop , when she  saw , stretched upon the sands , the image of the King which the Mermaid  had made with the sea - weeds . Struck with astonishment and sorrow , she  uttered a terrible cry , and threw herself down beside the pretended  King , weeping , and howling , and calling upon her eleven sisters , who  were also fairies , and who came to her assistance . But they were all  taken in by the image of the King , for , clever as they were , the Mermaid  was still cleverer , and all they could do was to help the Fairy of the  Desert to make a wonderful monument over what they thought was the grave  of the King of the Gold Mines . But while they were collecting jasper  and porphyry , agate and marble , gold and bronze , statues and devices ,  to immortalize the King ’s memory , he was thanking the good Mermaid and  begging her still to help him , which she graciously promised to do as  she disappeared ; and then he set out for the Castle of Steel . He walked  fast , looking anxiously round him , and longing once more to see his  darling Bellissima , but he had not gone far before he was surrounded by  four terrible sphinxes who would very soon have torn him to pieces with  their sharp talons if it had not been for the Mermaid ’s diamond sword .  For , no sooner had he flashed it before their eyes than down they fell  at his feet quite helpless , and he killed them with one blow . But he  had hardly turned to continue his search when he met six dragons covered  with scales that were harder than iron . Frightful as this encounter was  the King ’s courage was unshaken , and by the aid of his wonderful sword  he cut them in pieces one after the other . Now he hoped his difficulties  were over , but at the next turning he was met by one which he did  not know how to overcome . Four - and - twenty pretty and graceful nymphs  advanced toward him , holding garlands of flowers , with which they barred  the way .  “ Where are you going , Prince ? ” they said ; “ it is our duty to guard this  place , and if we let you pass great misfortunes will happen to you  and to us . We beg you not to insist upon going on . Do you want to kill  four - and - twenty girls who have never displeased you in any way ? ”

""  THE YOUNG BLUE JAY WHO WAS NOT BRAVE ENOUGH TO BE AFRAID  Everybody who is acquainted with the Blue Jays knows that they are a  very brave family . That is the best thing that you can say about them .  To be sure , they dress very handsomely , and there is no prettier sight ,  on a fine winter morning , than a flock of Blue Jays flitting from  branch to branch , dining off the acorns on the oak trees , and cocking  their crested heads on one side as they look over the country . They are  great talkers then , and are always telling each other just what to do ;  yet none of them ever do what they are told to , so they might just as  well stop giving advice .  The other people of the forest do not like the Blue Jays at all , and if  one of them gets into trouble they will not help him out . This always  has been so , and it always will be so . If it could be winter all the  time , the Blue Jays could be liked well enough , for in cold weather they  eat seeds and nuts and do not quarrel so much with others . It is in the  summer that they become bad neighbors . Then they live in the thickest  part of the woods and raise families of tiny , fuzzy babies in their  great coarse nests . It is then , too , that they change their beautiful  coats , and while the old feathers are dropping off and the new ones are  growing they are not at all pretty . Oh , then is the time to beware of  the Blue Jays !  They do very little talking during the summer , and the forest people do  not know when they are coming , unless they see a flutter of blue wings  among the branches . The Blue Jays have a reason for keeping still then .  They are doing sly things , and they do not want to be found out .  The wee babies grow fast and their mouths are always open for more

"	" At the end of their third march they were disagreeably surprised by the  arrival in their camp of a hammered iron slug which , fired from a steady  rest at seven hundred yards , flicked out the brains of a private seated by  the fire . This robbed them of their peace for a night , and was the  beginning of a long - range fire carefully calculated to that end . In the  daytime they saw nothing except an occasional puff of smoke from a crag  above the line of march . At night there were distant spurts of flame and  occasional casualties , which set the whole camp blazing into the gloom ,  and , occasionally , into opposite tents . Then they swore vehemently and  vowed that this was magnificent but not war .  Indeed it was not . The Regiment could not halt for reprisals against the  _ franctireurs _ of the country side . Its duty was to go forward and make  connection with the Scotch and Gurkha troops with which it was brigaded .  The Afghans knew this , and knew too , after their first tentative shots ,  that they were dealing with a raw regiment . Thereafter they devoted  themselves to the task of keeping the Fore and Aft on the strain . Not for  anything would they have taken equal liberties with a seasoned corps -- with  the wicked little Gurkhas , whose delight it was to lie out in the open on  a dark night and stalk their stalkers -- with the terrible , big men dressed  in women 's clothes , who could be heard praying to their God in the  night - watches , and whose peace of mind no amount of "" sniping "" could  shake -- or with those vile Sikhs , who marched so ostentatiously unprepared  and who dealt out such grim reward to those who tried to profit by that  unpreparedness . This white regiment was different -- quite different . It  slept like a hog , and , like a hog , charged in every direction when it was  roused . Its sentries walked with a footfall that could be heard for a  quarter of a mile ; would fire at anything that moved -- even a driven  donkey -- and when they had once fired , could be scientifically "" rushed "" and  laid out a horror and an offence against the morning sun . Then there were  camp - followers who straggled and could be cut up without fear . Their  shrieks would disturb the white boys , and the loss of their services would  inconvenience them sorely .  Thus , at every march , the hidden enemy became bolder and the regiment  writhed and twisted under

She paled a little when they  met face to face , and she shrank from him shyly .   But he took her hand  and kissed her frankly ; and the two were glad , and had no need to tell  each other of their joy , though much else they deemed they had to say ,  could they have found words thereto .

"<fantasy>  So now all the host went on together , and when they had passed the  Galting abodes , there was nothing between them and Bearham , nor need they  look for any further help of men ; there were no beasts afield nor any to  herd them , and the stay - at - homes were within doors dighting them for  departure into the wild - wood if need should be : but a little while after  they had passed these dwellings came into the host two swains of about  twenty winters , and a doughty maid , their sister , and they bare no  weapons save short spears and knives ; they were wet and dripping with the  water , for they had just swum Mirkwood - water .
"	"  They were of the Wolfing  House , and had been shepherding a few sheep on the west side of the  water , when they saw the host faring to battle , and might not refrain  them , but swam their horses across the swift deeps to join their kindred  to live and die with them .   The tale tells that they three fought in the  battles that followed after , and were not slain there , though they  entered them unarmed , but lived long years afterwards : of them need no  more be said .  Now , when the host was but a little past the Galting dwellings men began  to see the flames mingled with the smoke of the burning , and the smoke  itself growing thinner , as though the fire had over - mastered everything  and was consuming itself with its own violence ; and somewhat afterwards ,  the ground rising , they could see the Bearing meadow and the foemen  thereon : yet a little further , and from the height of another swelling of  the earth they could see the burning houses themselves and the array of  the Romans ; so there they stayed and breathed their horses a while .   And  they beheld how of the Romans a great company was gathered together in  close array betwixt the ford and the Bearing Hall , but nigher unto the  ford , and these were a short mile from them ; but others they saw  streaming out from the burning dwellings , as if their work were done  there , and they could not see that they had any captives with them .   Other  Romans there were , and amongst them men in the attire of the Goths ,  busied about the river banks , as though they were going to try the ford .  But a little while abode Otter in that place , and then waved his arm and  rode on and all the host followed ; and as they drew nigher , Otter , who  was wise in war , beheld the Romans and deemed them a great host , and the  very kernel and main body of them many more than all his company ; and  moreover they were duly and well arrayed as men waiting a foe ; so he knew  that he must be wary or he would lose himself and all his men .  So he stayed his company when they were about two furlongs from them , and  the main body of the foe stirred not , but horsemen and slingers came  forth from its sides and made on toward the Goths , and in three or four  minutes were within bowshot of them .   Then the bowmen of the

Let us seek him  out . ”  With this design they sought for Ten - teh and finding him in his hut  they confidently invoked his assistance , pointing out how he would  save all their lives and receive great honour . To their dismay Ten - teh  received them with solemn curses and drove them from his door with  blows , calling them traitors , ungrateful ones , and rebellious subjects  whose minds were so far removed from submissive loyalty that rather  than perish harmlessly they would inopportunely thrust themselves in  upon the attention of the divine Emperor when his mind was full of  great matters and his thoughts tenaciously fixed upon the scheme for  reclaiming the abandoned outer lands of his forefathers . “ Behold , ” he  cried , “ when a hand is raised to sweep into oblivion a thousand  earthworms they lift no voice in protest , and in this matter ye are  less than earthworms . The dogs are content to starve dumbly while  their masters feast , and ye are less than dogs . The dutiful son  cheerfully submits himself to torture on the chance that his father ’s  sufferings may be lessened , and the Emperor , as the supreme head , is  more to be venerated than any father ; but your hearts are sheathed in  avarice and greed . ” Thus he drove them away , and their last hope being  gone they wandered back to the forest , wailing and filling the air  with their despairing moans ; for the brief light that had inspired  them was extinguished and the thought that by a patient endurance they  might spare the Emperor an unnecessary pang was not a sufficient  recompense in their eyes .  The time of warmth and green life passed . With winter came floods and  snow - storms , great tempests from the north and bitter winds that cut  men down as though they had been smitten by the sword . The rivers and  lagoons were frozen over ; the meagre sustenance of the earth lay  hidden beneath an impenetrable crust of snow and ice , until those who  had hitherto found it a desperate chance to live from day to day now  abandoned the unequal struggle for the more attractive certainty of a  swift and painless death . One by one the fires went out in the houses  of the dead ; the ever - increasing snow broke down the walls . Wild  beasts from the mountains walked openly about the deserted streets ,  thrust themselves through such doors as were closed against them and  lurked by night in the most sacred recesses of the ruined temples .

"	"Thus , then , one of our own noble  stamp , even a whaleman , is the tutelary guardian of England ; and by  good rights , we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most  noble order of St. George . And therefore , let not the knights of that  honorable company ( none of whom , I venture to say , have ever had to do  with a whale like their great patron ) , let them never eye a Nantucketer  with disdain , since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we  are much better entitled to St. George ’s decoration than they .  Whether to admit Hercules among us or not , concerning this I long  remained dubious : for though according to the Greek mythologies , that  antique Crockett and Kit Carson — that brawny doer of rejoicing good  deeds , was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale ; still , whether that  strictly makes a whaleman of him , that might be mooted . It nowhere  appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish , unless , indeed , from  the inside . Nevertheless , he may be deemed a sort of involuntary  whaleman ; at any rate the whale caught him , if he did not the whale . I  claim him for one of our clan .  But , by the best contradictory authorities , this Grecian story of  Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more  ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale ; and vice versâ ; certainly  they are very similar . If I claim the demi - god then , why not the  prophet ?  Nor do heroes , saints , demigods , and prophets alone comprise the whole  roll of our order . Our grand master is still to be named ; for like  royal kings of old times , we find the head waters of our fraternity in  nothing short of the great gods themselves . That wondrous oriental  story is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster , which gives us the dread  Vishnoo , one of the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos ; gives  us this divine Vishnoo himself for our Lord;—Vishnoo , who , by the first  of his ten earthly incarnations , has for ever set apart and sanctified  the whale . When Brahma , or the God of Gods , saith the Shaster , resolved  to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions , he gave  birth to Vishnoo , to preside over the work ; but the Vedas , or mystical  books , whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo  before beginning the creation , and which therefore

The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellson ’s  establishment was put through the door , and the word was given :  “ Porter wanted ! ”  “ Hooray , father !

Indeed , he did not need to be informed of the  priceless value of the treasure , which he beheld in the rosy palm  extended toward him .   How long he gazed at this extraordinary jewel he  knew not , but he was aroused from his contemplation by the sound of the  lady 's voice addressing him .

The ladies had gone upstairs ,  and no one sat on my right ; on my left there was a man I did not know , but  he knew my name somehow apparently , for he turned to me after a while , and  said , "" I read a story of yours about Bethmoora in a review .

I said , "" Oh ,  yes , "" and slowly searched in my mind for some more fitting acknowledgment  of the compliment that his memory had paid me .  I was greatly astonished when he said , "" You were wrong about the gnousar  sickness ; it was not that at all . ""  I said , "" Why ! Have you been there ? ""  And he said , "" Yes ; I do it with hashish . I know Bethmoora well . "" And he  took out of his pocket a small box full of some black stuff that looked  like tar , but had a stranger smell . He warned me not to touch it with my  finger , as the stain remained for days . "" I got it from a gipsy , "" he said .  "" He had a lot of it , as it had killed his father . "" But I interrupted him ,  for I wanted to know for certain what it was that had made desolate that  beautiful city , Bethmoora , and why they fled from it swiftly in a day .  "" Was it because of the Desert 's curse ? "" I asked . And he said , "" Partly it  was the fury of the Desert and partly the advice of the Emperor Thuba  Mleen , for that fearful beast is in some way connected with the Desert on  his mother 's side .

"<fairy> Subject to this , and other the like interruptions now  and then , a conversation was sustained between the two parties ; but at  intervals not without still another interruption of a very different  sort .
"	" Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam ’s boat , was a man of a singular  appearance , even in that wild whaling life where individual  notabilities make up all totalities . He was a small , short , youngish  man , sprinkled all over his face with freckles , and wearing redundant  yellow hair . A long - skirted , cabalistically - cut coat of a faded walnut  tinge enveloped him ; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on  his wrists . A deep , settled , fanatic delirium was in his eyes .  So soon as this figure had been first descried , Stubb had  exclaimed—“That ’s he ! that ’s he!—the long - togged scaramouch the  Town - Ho ’s company told us of ! ” Stubb here alluded to a strange story  told of the Jeroboam , and a certain man among her crew , some time  previous when the Pequod spoke the Town - Ho . According to this account  and what was subsequently learned , it seemed that the scaramouch in  question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the  Jeroboam . His story was this :  He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna  Shakers , where he had been a great prophet ; in their cracked , secret  meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a  trap - door , announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial , which he  carried in his vest - pocket ; but , which , instead of containing  gunpowder , was supposed to be charged with laudanum . A strange ,  apostolic whim having seized him , he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket ,  where , with that cunning peculiar to craziness , he assumed a steady ,  common - sense exterior , and offered himself as a green - hand candidate  for the Jeroboam ’s whaling voyage . They engaged him ; but straightway  upon the ship ’s getting out of sight of land , his insanity broke out in  a freshet . He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel , and commanded  the captain to jump overboard . He published his manifesto , whereby he  set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and  vicar - general of all Oceanica . The unflinching earnestness with which  he declared these things;—the dark , daring play of his sleepless ,  excited imagination , and all the preternatural terrors of real  delirium , united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of  the ignorant crew , with an atmosphere of sacredness . Moreover , they  were afraid of him . As such a man , however , was not of much practical  use

"<fantasy> And the light of the Kilns struck the brow of  this black Headland ; so that , constantly , I saw things peer over the  edge , coming forward a little into the light of the Kilns , and drawing  back swiftly into the shadows .
"	"And thus it had been ever , through the  uncounted ages ; so that the Headland was known as The Headland From  Which Strange Things Peer ; and thus was it marked in our maps and charts  of that grim world .  And so I could go on ever ; but that I fear to weary ; and yet , whether I  do weary , or not , I must tell of this country that I see , even now as I  set my thoughts down , so plainly that my memory wanders in a hushed and  secret fashion along its starkness , and amid its strange and dread  habitants , so that it is but by an effort I realise me that my body is  not there in this very moment that I write . And so to further tellings :  Before me ran the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk ; and I searched it , as  many a time in my earlier youth had I , with the spy - glass ; for my heart  was always stirred mightily by the sight of those Silent Ones .  And , presently , alone in all the miles of that night - grey road , I saw  one in the field of my glass -- a quiet , cloaked figure , moving along ,  shrouded , and looking neither to right nor left . And thus was it with  these beings ever . It was told about in the Redoubt that they would harm  no human , if but the human did keep a fair distance from them ; but that  it were wise never to come close upon one . And this I can well believe .  And so , searching the road with my gaze , I passed beyond this Silent  One , and past the place where the road , sweeping vastly to the  South - East , was lit a space , strangely , by the light from the  Silver - fire Holes . And thus at last to where it swayed to the South of  the Dark Palace , and thence Southward still , until it passed round to  the Westward , beyond the mountain bulk of the Watching Thing in the  South -- the hugest monster in all the visible Night Lands . My spy - glass  showed it to me with clearness -- a living hill of watchfulness , known to  us as The Watcher Of The South . It brooded there , squat and tremendous ,  hunched over the pale radiance of the Glowing Dome .  Much , I know , had been writ concerning this Odd , Vast Watcher ; for it  had grown out of the blackness of the South Unknown Lands a million  years gone ; and

"	" But the next day they found the tree again , and it was nigher to the  ladders than heretofore ; Grettir drave it out to sea , and said that it  should never be borne home .  Now the days wore on into summer , and a gale came on with much wet ,  and the brothers were loth to be abroad , and bade Noise go search for  firewood .  He took it ill , and said he was ill served in that he had to drudge  and labour abroad in all the foulest weather ; but withal he went down  to the beach before the ladders and found the carline 's tree there ,  and deemed things had gone well because of it ; so he took it up and  bore it to the hut , and cast it down thereby with a mighty thump .  Grettir heard it and said , "" Noise has got something , so I shall go out  and see what it is . ""  Therewithal he took up a wood - axe , and went out , and straightway Noise  said ,  "" Split it up in as good wise as I have brought it home , then . ""  Grettir grew short of temper with the thrall , and smote the axe with  both hands at the log , nor heeded what tree it was ; but as soon as  ever the axe touched the wood , it turned flatlings and glanced off  therefrom into Grettir 's right leg above the knee , in such wise that  it stood in the bone , and a great wound was that . Then he looked at  the tree and said ,  "" Now has evil heart prevailed , nor will this hap go alone , since that  same tree has now come back to us that I have cast out to sea on these  two days . But for thee , Noise , two slips hast thou had , first , when  thou must needs let the fire be slaked , and now this bearing home of  that tree of ill - hap ; but if a third thou hast , thy bane will it be ,  and the bane of us all . ""  With that came Illugi and bound up Grettir 's hurt , and it bled little ,  and Grettir slept well that night ; and so three nights slipped by in  such wise that no pain came of the wound , and when they loosed the  swathings , the lips of the wound were come together so that it was  well - nigh grown over again . Then said Illugi ,  "" Belike thou wilt have no long hurt of this wound . ""

While the three grim men prostrated themselves by  their fire , and the horrible woman that was the spouse of one , he saw  the gods coming gauntly over the wold , beheld the gods of Old England  hungrily snuffing the savour , Odin , Balder , and Thor , the gods of the  ancient people , beheld them eye to eye clear and close in the  twilight , and the office of postman fell vacant in  Otford - under - the - Wold .  THE PRAYER OF BOOB AHEERA  In the harbour , between the liner and the palms , as the huge ship 's  passengers came up from dinner , at moonrise , each in his canoe , Ali  Kareeb Ahash and Boob Aheera passed within knife thrust .  So urgent was the purpose of Ali Kareeb Ahash that he did not lean  over as his enemy slid by , did not tarry then to settle that long  account ; but that Boob Aheera made no attempt to reach him was a  source of wonder to Ali .   He pondered it till the liner 's electric  lights shone far away behind him with one blaze and the canoe was near  to his destination , and pondered it in vain , for all that the eastern  subtlety of his mind was able to tell him clearly was that it was not  like Boob Aheera to pass him like that .  That Boob Aheera could have dared to lay such a cause as his before  the Diamond Idol Ali had not conceived , yet as he drew near to the  golden shrine in the palms , that none that come by the great ships  ever found , he began to see more clearly in his mind that this was  where Boob had gone on that hot night .   And when he beached his canoe  his fears departed , giving place to the resignation with which he  always viewed Destiny ; for there on the white sea sand were the tracks  of another canoe , the edges all fresh and ragged .   Boob Aheera had  been before him .   Ali did not blame himself for being late , the thing  had been planned before the beginning of time , by gods that knew their  business ; only his hate of Boob Aheera increased , his enemy against  whom he had come to pray .   And the more his hate increased the more  clearly he saw him , until nothing else could be seen by the eye of his

Down here below there was such a storm ; it threw down long tracts of  wood and many houses , and when it swept over the great sea , ships  foundered by hundreds .  So they tore on and on -- no one can believe how far they went -- and all  the while they still went over the sea , and the North Wind got more  and more weary , and so out of breath he could scarce bring out a puff ,  and his wings drooped and drooped , till at last he sunk so low that  the crests of the waves dashed over his heels .

Next morning the lassie sat down under the castle window , and began to  play with the gold apple ; and the first person she saw was the  _ Long - nose _ who was to have the _ Prince _ .

Upon  the tranquil little islands her life had been eventless , and all the  fine possibilities of her nature were like flowers that never bloomed .  Placid were all her years ; yet I have read of no heroine , of no woman  great in sudden crises , that it did not seem to me she might have  been . The wife and widow of a man who loved his own home better than  the homes of others , I have yet heard of no queen , no belle , no  imperial beauty , whom in grace , and brilliancy , and persuasive  courtesy , she might not have surpassed .  "" Madam , "" said Titbottom to my wife , whose heart hung upon his story ;  "" your husband 's young friend , Aurelia , wears sometimes a camelia in  her hair , and no diamond in the ball - room seems so costly as that  perfect flower , which women envy , and for whose least and withered  petal men sigh ; yet , in the tropical solitudes of Brazil , how many a  camelia bud drops from a bush that no eye has ever seen , which , had it  flowered and been noticed , would have gilded all hearts with its  memory .  "" When I stole these furtive glances at my grandmother , half fearing  that they were wrong , I saw only a calm lake , whose shores were low ,  and over which the sky hung unbroken , so that the least star was  clearly reflected . It had an atmosphere of solemn twilight  tranquillity , and so completely did its unruffled surface blend with  the cloudless , star - studded sky , that , when I looked through my  spectacles at my grandmother , the vision seemed to me all heaven and  stars . Yet , as I gazed and gazed , I felt what stately cities might  well have been built upon those shores , and have flashed prosperity  over

"	"But that was not entirely satisfactory . There were other and  pleasanter emotions mixed in with this humility . The thought of her  made him feel , for instance , vaguely chivalrous . He wanted to do risky  and useful things for her . Thus , if any fresh guy should endeavor to  get gay with her , it would , he felt , be a privilege to fix that same  guy . If she should be in bad , he would be more than ready to get busy  on her behalf .  But he had never expected to meet her again , certainly not on his own  doorstep at ten in the morning . To Bat ten in the morning was included  with the small hours .  Betty smiled at him , a little anxiously . She had no suspicion that she  played star to Mr. Jarvis ' moth in the latter 's life , and , as she eyed  him , standing there on the doorstep , her excuse for coming to him began  to seem terribly flimsy . Not being aware that he was in reality a tough  Bayard , keenly desirous of obeying her lightest word , she had staked  her all on the chance of his remembering the cat episode and being  grateful on account of it ; and in the cold light of the morning this  idea , born in the watches of the night , when things tend to lose their  proportion , struck her as less happy than she had fancied . Suppose he  had forgotten all about it ! Suppose he should be violent ! For a moment  her heart sank . He certainly was not a pleasing and encouraging sight ,  as he stood there blinking at her . No man looks his best immediately on  rising from bed , and Bat , even at his best , was not a hero of romance .  His forelock drooped dankly over his brow ; there was stubble on his  chin ; his eyes were red , like a dog 's . He did not look like the Fairy  Prince who was to save her in her trouble .  "" I -- I hope you remember me , Mr. Jarvis , "" she faltered . "" Your cat . I-- ""  He nodded speechlessly . Hideous things happened to his face . He was  really trying to smile pleasantly , but it seemed a scowl to Betty , and  her voice died away .  Mr. Jarvis spoke .  "" Ma'am -- sure!--step ' nside . ""  Betty followed him into the shop . There were birds in cages on the  walls , and , patroling the floor , a great company of cats , each with its  leather

"" Well , "" she said , "" I shall say what likes me when the hour is at hand .  Lo , here ! thine horse .   Abide yet a moment of time , and then go whither  thou needs must , like the wind of the summer day .

""  Therewith she kissed him on either cheek and embraced him ; and it might  be said of her and him that she let him go thereafter ; for though as  aforesaid he loved her , and praised her kindness , he scarce understood  the eagerness of her love for him ; whereas moreover she saw him not so  often betwixt Upmeads and Wulstead :   and belike she herself scarce  understood it .   Albeit she was a childless woman .  So when he had got to horse , she watched him riding a moment , and saw  how he waved his hand to her as he turned the corner of the  market - place , and how a knot of lads and lasses stood staring on him  after she lost sight of him .   Then she turned her back into the chamber  and laid her head on the table and wept .

"<fantasy> By an old and lonely path , I will lead them so  prudently that they shall not be seen or met by Saxon or German  till they will be able to take the maiden in her tent , and lead  her away so unhindered that never will she be denied them .
"	""" The  duke is blithe at this thing . He has sent a hundred and more wise  knights with the spy ; and the spy has led them in such wise that  they take the maiden as a prize , nor have they spent great force  thereon , for easily were they able to lead her away . When they  had taken her some distance from the tents , they sent her away  attended by twelve of them , nor did the rest accompany the twelve  far . Twelve of them lead away the maiden ; the others have told  the duke the news of their success . Nought else was there that  the duke had desired , and straightway he makes a truce with the  Greeks till the morrow . They have given and accepted a truce . The  duke 's men have returned ; and the Greeks without any delay return ,  each one to his tent . But Cliges remained alone on a hill so  that no one noticed him till he saw the twelve coming , and the  damsel whom they were taking away at full speed and at a gallop .  Cliges , who longs to gain renown , forthwith dashes in their  direction , for he thinks to himself , and his heart tells him that  it is not for nothing they are fleeing . The very moment that he  saw them , he dashes after them ; and they see him ; but they think  and believe a foolish thing .

Never would he have  recognised their insignia if they had not come to meet him , or if  they had not awaited him . Six of them advanced to meet him ; but  soon will they have had an ill meeting with him . The others stay  with the maiden and lead her on , gently , at a walking pace . And  the six go at full speed , spurring incessantly through the  valley . He who had the swiftest horse outstripped all the rest ,  crying aloud : "" Duke of Saxony ! God preserve thee ! Duke !

"	" Not till morning did the boys come , and when they found the bird dead ,  they wept many and bitter tears . They dug a pretty grave for him and  adorned it with leaves of flowers . The bird 's lifeless body was placed  in a smart red box and was buried with great honor .  Poor bird ! while he was alive and could sing , they forgot him and  allowed him to sit in his cage and suffer want , but now that he was  dead , they mourned for him with many tears and buried him in royal  state .  But the turf with the daisy on it was thrown out into the dusty road . No  one thought of the little flower that had felt more for the poor bird  than had any one else and that would have been so glad to help and  comfort him if she had been able .  THE PEA BLOSSOM  THERE were once five peas in one shell ; they were green , and the shell  was green , and so they believed that the whole world must be green also ,  which was a very natural conclusion .  The shell grew , and the peas grew ; and as they grew they arranged  themselves all in a row . The sun shone without and warmed the shell , and  the rain made it clear and transparent ; it looked mild and agreeable in  broad daylight and dark at night , just as it should . And the peas , as  they sat there , grew bigger and bigger , and more thoughtful as they  mused , for they felt there must be something for them to do .  "" Are we to sit here forever ? "" asked one . "" Shall we not become hard ,  waiting here so long ? It seems to me there must be something outside ; I  feel sure of it . ""  Weeks passed by ; the peas became yellow , and the shell became yellow .  "" All the world is turning yellow , I suppose , "" said they -- and perhaps  they were right .  Suddenly they felt a pull at the shell . It was torn off and held in  human hands ; then it was slipped into the pocket of a jacket , together  with other full pods .  "" Now we shall soon be let out , "" said one , and that was just what they  all wanted .

"<fairy>  Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising  ground , the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery .
"	"Often , in mild ,  pleasant weather , for twelve , fifteen , eighteen , and twenty hours on  the stretch , they were engaged in the boats , steadily pulling , or  sailing , or paddling after the whales , or for an interlude of sixty or  seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising ; though with but small  success for their pains .  At such times , under an abated sun ; afloat all day upon smooth , slow  heaving swells ; seated in his boat , light as a birch canoe ; and so  sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves , that like hearth - stone  cats they purr against the gunwale ; these are the times of dreamy  quietude , when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the  ocean ’s skin , one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it ; and  would not willingly remember , that this velvet paw but conceals a  remorseless fang .  These are the times , when in his whale - boat the rover softly feels a  certain filial , confident , land - like feeling towards the sea ; that he  regards it as so much flowery earth ; and the distant ship revealing  only the tops of her masts , seems struggling forward , not through high  rolling waves , but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie : as when  the western emigrants ’ horses only show their erected ears , while their  hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure .  The long - drawn virgin vales ; the mild blue hill - sides ; as over these  there steals the hush , the hum ; you almost swear that play - wearied  children lie sleeping in these solitudes , in some glad May - time , when  the flowers of the woods are plucked . And all this mixes with your most  mystic mood ; so that fact and fancy , half - way meeting , interpenetrate ,  and form one seamless whole .

But Goldilind took all with a high heart , and her courage grew with  her years , nor would she bow the head before any grief , but took to her  whatsoever solace might come to her ; as the pleasure of the sun and the  wind , and the beholding of the greenery of the wood , and the fowl and  the beasts playing , which oft she saw afar , and whiles anear , though  whiles , forsooth , she saw nought of it all , whereas she was shut up  betwixt four walls , and that not of her chamber , but of some bare and  foul prison of the Castle , which , with other griefs , must she needs  thole under the name and guise of penance .  However , she waxed so exceeding fair and sweet and lovely , that the  loveliness of her pierced to the hearts of many of her jailers , so that  some of them , and specially of the squires and men - at - arms , would do her  some easement which they might do unrebuked , or not sorely rebuked ;  as bringing her flowers in the spring , or whiles a singing - bird or a  squirrel ; and an old man there was of the men - at - arms , who would ask  leave , and get it at whiles , to come to her in her chamber , or the  garden ? and tell her minstrel tales and the like for her joyance . Sooth  to say , even the pinched heart of the old Burgreve was somewhat touched  by her ; and he alone had any might to stand between her and Dame Elinor ;  so that but for him it had gone much harder with her than it did .  For the rest , none entered the Castle from the world without , nay not so  much as a travelling monk , or a friar on his wanderings ,

The Tin Woodman had asked Dorothy to put the oil - can in her basket .  “ For , ” he said , “ if I should get caught in the rain , and rust again , I  would need the oil - can badly . ”  It was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party , for  soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place  where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the  travelers could not pass .

Dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not  notice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the  side of the road . Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up  again .  “ Why did n’t you walk around the hole ? ” asked the Tin Woodman .  “ I do n’t know enough , ” replied the Scarecrow cheerfully . “ My head is  stuffed with straw , you know , and that is why I am going to Oz to ask  him for some brains . ”  “ Oh , I see , ” said the Tin Woodman . “ But , after all , brains are not the  best things in the world . ”  “ Have you any ? ” inquired the Scarecrow .  “ No , my head is quite empty , ” answered the Woodman . “ But once I had  brains ,

"	"Two of these were Shen Yi and a trusted slave ;  at the sight of the third Chang Tao ’s face grew very red and the  deficiencies of his various attributes began to fill his mind with  dark forebodings , for this was Melodious Vision and no man could look  upon her without her splendour engulfing his imagination . No record of  her pearly beauty is preserved beyond a scattered phrase or two ; for  the poets and minstrels of the age all burned what they had written ,  in despair at the inadequacy of words . Yet it remains that whatever a  man looked for , that he found , and the measure of his requirement was  not stinted .  “ Greeting , ” said Shen Yi , with easy - going courtesy . He was a more  meagre man than Chang Tao had expected , his face not subtle , and his  manner restrained rather than oppressive . “ You have come on a long and  winding path ; have you taken your rice ? ”  “ Nothing remains lacking , ” replied Chang Tao , his eyes again  elsewhere . “ Command your slave , Excellence . ”  “ In what particular direction do your agreeable powers of  leisure - beguiling extend ? ”  So far Chang Tao had left the full consideration of this inevitable  detail to the inspiration of the moment , but when the moment came the  prompting spirits did not disclose themselves . His hesitation became  more elaborate under the expression of gathering enlightenment that  began to appear in Melodious Vision ’s eyes .  “ An indifferent store of badly sung ballads , ” he was constrained to  reply at length , “ and -- perchance -- a threadbare assortment of involved  questions and replies . ”  “ Was it your harmonious voice that we were privileged to hear raised  beneath our ill - fitting window a brief space ago ? ” inquired Shen Yi .  “ Admittedly at the sight of this noble palace I was impelled to put my  presumptuous gladness into song . ”  “ Then let it fain be the other thing , ” interposed the maiden , with  decision . “ Your gladness came to a sad end , minstrel . ”  “ Involved questions are by no means void of divertisement , ” remarked  Shen Yi , with conciliatory mildness in his voice . “ There was one ,  turning on the contradictory nature of a door which under favourable  conditions was indistinguishable from an earthenware vessel , that  seldom failed to baffle the unalert in the days before the binding of  this person ’s hair . ”  “ That was the one which it had been my feeble

Then she laughed .  “ Eh ! th ’ art a queer , old - womanish thing , ” she said . “ If tha’d been our  ’ Lizabeth Ellen tha’d have given me a kiss . ”  Mary looked stiffer than ever .  “ Do you want me to kiss you ? ”  Martha laughed again .  “ Nay , not me , ” she answered . “ If tha ’ was different , p’raps tha’d want  to thysel ’ .

She skipped round the fountain garden , and up one  walk and down another . She skipped at last into the kitchen - garden and  saw Ben Weatherstaff digging and talking to his robin , which was  hopping about him . She skipped down the walk toward him and he lifted  his head and looked at her with a curious expression . She had wondered  if he would notice her .

At that they drew their swords and set upon each other fiercely , with  passing grievous strokes .  Now Sir Gawain had through magic a marvellous great gift . For every day ,  from morning till noon , his strength waxed to the might of seven men , but  after that waned to his natural force . Therefore till noon he gave Sir  Lancelot many mighty buffets , which scarcely he endured . Yet greatly he  forbore Sir Gawain , for he was aware of his enchantment , and smote him  slightly till his own knights marvelled . But after noon Sir Gawain 's  strength sank fast , and then , with one full blow , Sir Lancelot laid him on  the earth . Then Sir Gawain cried out , "" Turn not away , thou traitor knight ,   but slay me if thou wilt , or else I will arise and fight with thee again  some other time .

But now came tidings to King Arthur from across the sea , which caused him  to return in haste . For thus the news ran , that no sooner was Sir Modred  set up in his regency , than he had forged false tidings from abroad that  the king had fallen in a battle with Sir Lancelot . Whereat he had  proclaimed himself the king , and had been crowned at Canterbury , where he  had held a coronation feast for fifteen days . Then he had gone to  Winchester , where Queen Guinevere abode , and had commanded her to be his  wife ; whereto , for fear and sore perplexity , she had feigned consent , but ,  under pretext of preparing for the marriage , had fled in haste to London  and taken shelter in the Tower , fortifying it and providing it with all  manner of victuals , and defending it against Sir Modred , and answering to  all his threats that she would rather slay herself than be his queen .  Thus was it written to King Arthur . Then , in passing great wrath and  haste , he came with all his army swiftly back from France and sailed to  England .

"<fairy> It was about time , for Mrs. Ellsworth , up in the bare  suite , and Mrs. Van Kamp , down in the draughty barn , both wrapped up  to the chin and both still chilly , had about reached the limit of  patience and endurance .

"" Suppose , as a starter , that we  have Mrs. Van Kamp give a shiver party down in the barn ? ""  "" Good idea , "" agreed Mr. Ellsworth . "" A little diplomacy will do it .

"" gasped Mr. Van Kamp . "" By all means ! ""  Both men felt an anxious yawning in the region of the appetite , and a  yearning moisture wetted their tongues . They looked at the slumbering  Uncle Billy and decided to see Mrs. Tutt themselves about a good , hot  dinner for six .  "" Law me !

"<fantasy>  And the next day they held a grand tourney , that I might be proven ; and I  had never fought with knights before , yet I did not doubt .
"	"  And Alys sat  under a green canopy , that she might give the degree to the best knight ,  and by her sat the good knight Sir Guy , in a long robe , for he did not  mean to joust that day ; and indeed at first none but young knights  jousted , for they thought that I should not do much .  But I , looking up to the green canopy , overthrew so many of them , that  the elder knights began to arm , and I grew most joyful as I met them , and  no man unhorsed me ; and always I broke my spear fairly , or else overthrew  my adversary .  Now that maiden who counselled me in the hall , told me afterwards that as  I fought , the Lady Alys held fast to the rail before her , and leaned  forward and was most pale , never answering any word that any one might  say to her , till the Knight Guy said to her in anger : ' Alys ! what ails  you ? you would have been glad enough to speak to me when King Wadrayns  carried you off shrieking , or that other time when the chain went round  about you , and the faggots began to smoke in the Brown City : do you not  love me any longer ?   O Alys , Alys ! just think a little , and do not break  your faith with me ; God hates nothing so much as this .   Sweet , try to  love me , even for your own sake !   See , am I not kind to you ?

Now till about this time I had made no cry as I jousted .   But there came  against me a very tall knight , on a great horse , and when we met our  spears both shivered , and he howled with vexation , for he wished to slay  me , being the brother of that knight I had struck down in the hall the  day before .  And they say that when Alys heard his howl sounding faintly through the  bars of his great helm , she trembled ; but I know not , for I was stronger  than that knight , and when we fought with swords , I struck him right out  of his saddle , and near slew him with that stroke .

"<fairy>  Now , as the business of standing mast - heads , ashore or afloat , is a  very ancient and interesting one , let us in some measure expatiate  here .
"	"I take it , that the earliest standers of mast - heads were the old  Egyptians ; because , in all my researches , I find none prior to them .  For though their progenitors , the builders of Babel , must doubtless , by  their tower , have intended to rear the loftiest mast - head in all Asia ,  or Africa either ; yet ( ere the final truck was put to it ) as that great  stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board , in the  dread gale of God ’s wrath ; therefore , we can not give these Babel  builders priority over the Egyptians . And that the Egyptians were a  nation of mast - head standers , is an assertion based upon the general  belief among archæologists , that the first pyramids were founded for  astronomical purposes : a theory singularly supported by the peculiar  stair - like formation of all four sides of those edifices ; whereby , with  prodigious long upliftings of their legs , those old astronomers were  wo nt to mount to the apex , and sing out for new stars ; even as the  look - outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail , or a whale just bearing  in sight . In Saint Stylites , the famous Christian hermit of old times ,  who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole  latter portion of his life on its summit , hoisting his food from the  ground with a tackle ; in him we have a remarkable instance of a  dauntless stander - of - mast - heads ; who was not to be driven from his  place by fogs or frosts , rain , hail , or sleet ; but valiantly facing  everything out to the last , literally died at his post . Of modern  standers - of - mast - heads we have but a lifeless set ; mere stone , iron ,  and bronze men ; who , though well capable of facing out a stiff gale ,  are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon  discovering any strange sight . There is Napoleon ; who , upon the top of  the column of Vendome , stands with arms folded , some one hundred and  fifty feet in the air ; careless , now , who rules the decks below ;  whether Louis Philippe , Louis Blanc , or Louis the Devil . Great  Washington , too , stands high aloft on his towering main - mast in  Baltimore , and like one of Hercules ’ pillars , his column marks that  point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go .

"<fantasy>   The Knight went and found there two women , who were all  busied in arraying the woman who had been brought to bed .
"	"  The child was  wrapped in linen clothes , and they had laid him on a chair .   Thereto came  the Knight , and took the child and laid him on a board , and brought him  to the Emperor , in such wise that none of the women wotted thereof .   The  Emperor did do slit the belly of him with a knife from the breast down to  the navel , and said withal to the Knight , that never should the son of  that churl have to wife his daughter , nor be emperor after him .  Therewithal would the Emperor do the Knight to put forth his hand to the  belly , to seek out the heart ; but the Knight said to him : “ Ah , sir ,  a - God ’s mercy , what wouldst thou do ?   It is nought meet to thee , and if  folk were to wot thereof , great reproach wouldst thou get thee .   Let him  be at this present , for he is more than dead .   And if it please thee that  that one trouble more about the matter , I will bear him down to the sea  to drown him . ”   “ Yea , ” quoth the Emperor , “ bear him away thither , for  right sore do I hate him . ”  So the Knight took the child , and wrapped him in a cover - point of silk ,  and bore him down toward the sea .   But therewith had he pity of the  child , and said that by him should he never be drowned ; so he left him ,  all wrapped up as he was , on a midden before the gate of a certain abbey  of monks , who at that very nick of time were singing their matins .  When the monks had done singing their matins , they heard the child  crying , and they bore him before the Lord Abbot .   And the Abbot saw that  the child was fair , and said that he would do it to be nourished .  Therewith he did do unwrap it , and saw that it had the belly cloven from  the breast down to the navel .  The Abbot , so soon as it was day , bade come leeches , and asked of them  for how much they would heal the child and they craved for the healing of  him an hundred of bezants .   But he said that it would be more than  enough , for overmuch would the child be costing .   And so much did the  Abbot , that he made market with the surgeons for four - score bezants .   And

I should choose this if I  might , ” replied Amy , looking with great admiration at a string of gold  and ebony beads from which hung a heavy cross of the same .  “ I , too , covet that , but not as a necklace . Ah , no ! To me it is a  rosary , and as such I should use it like a good catholic , ” said Esther ,  eyeing the handsome thing wistfully .  “ Is it meant to use as you use the string of good - smelling wooden beads  hanging over your glass ? ” asked Amy .  “ Truly , yes , to pray with . It would be pleasing to the saints if one  used so fine a rosary as this , instead of wearing it as a vain bijou . ”  “ You seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers , Esther , and  always come down looking quiet and satisfied . I wish I could . ”  “ If Mademoiselle was a Catholic , she would find true comfort , but as  that is not to be , it would be well if you went apart each day to  meditate and pray , as did the good mistress whom I served before  Madame . She had a little chapel , and in it found solacement for much  trouble . ”  “ Would it be right for me to do so too ? ” asked Amy , who in her  loneliness felt the need of help of some sort , and found that she was  apt to forget her little book , now that Beth was not there to remind  her of it .  “ It would be excellent and charming , and I shall gladly arrange the  little dressing room for you if you like it . Say nothing to Madame , but  when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good thoughts ,  and pray the dear God preserve your sister . ”  Esther was truly pious , and quite sincere in her advice , for she had an  affectionate heart , and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety . Amy  liked the idea , and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next her  room , hoping it would do her good .  “ I wish I knew where all these pretty things would go when Aunt March  dies , ” she said , as she slowly replaced the shining rosary and shut the  jewel cases one by one .  “ To you

But I confess I have had one or two other matters upon my mind since  then . You see , Jurgen , the universe is rather large , and the running  of it is a considerable tax upon my time . I can not manage to see  anything like as much of my friends as I would be delighted to see  of them . And so perhaps , what with one thing and another , I have not  given you my undivided attention all through the year -- not every  moment of it , that is .

And of a sudden Jurgen  perceived that this Koshchei the Deathless was not particularly  intelligent . Then Jurgen wondered why he should ever have expected  Koshchei to be intelligent ? Koshchei was omnipotent , as men estimate  omnipotence : but by what course of reasoning had people come to  believe that Koshchei was clever , as men estimate cleverness ? The  fact that , to the contrary , Koshchei seemed well - meaning , but rather  slow of apprehension and a little needlessly fussy , went far toward  explaining a host of matters which had long puzzled Jurgen .  Cleverness was , of course , the most admirable of all traits : but  cleverness was not at

Besides , the lunar madness of the scheme was its  strength ; that the Queen would venture to cross half England  unprotected -- and Messire Heleigh on the face of him was a paste - board  buckler -- was an event which Leicester would neither anticipate nor on  report credit .

"<fairy> ""  CHAPTER XVII  THE MAN AT THE ASTOR  Refraining from discussing with Master Maloney the alleged  bone - headedness of girls , Smith went through into the inner room , and  found John sitting in the editorial chair , glancing through the latest  number of _ Peaceful Moments _ .
"	" "" Why , John , friend of my youth , "" he said , "" where have you been hiding  all this time ? I called you up at your office weeks ago , and an acid  voice informed me that you were no longer there . Have you been fired ? ""  "" Yes , "" said John . "" Why are n't you on the _ News _ any more ? Nobody  seemed to know where you were , till I met Faraday this morning , who  told me you were here . ""  Smith was conscious of an impression that in some subtle way John had  changed since their last meeting . For a moment he could not have said  what had given him this impression . Then it flashed upon him . Before ,  John had always been , like Mrs. Fezziwig in "" The Christmas Carol , "" one  vast substantial smile . He had beamed cheerfully on what to him was  evidently the best of all possible worlds . Now , however , it would seem  that doubts had occurred to him as to the universal perfection of  things . His face was graver . His eyes and his mouth alike gave evidence  of disturbing happenings .  In the matter of confidences , Smith was not a believer in spade - work .  If they were offered to him , he was invariably sympathetic , but he  never dug for them . That John had something on his mind was obvious ,  but he intended to allow him , if he wished to reveal it , to select his  own time for the revelation .  John , for his part , had no intention of sharing this particular trouble  even with Smith . It was too new and intimate for discussion .  It was only since his return to New York that the futility of his quest  had really come home to him . In the belief of having at last escaped  from Mervo he had been inclined to overlook obstacles . It had seemed to  him , while he waited for his late subjects to dismiss him , that , once  he could move , all would be simple . New York had dispelled that idea .  Logically , he saw with perfect clearness , there was no reason why he  and Betty should ever meet again .  To retain a spark of hope beneath this knowledge was not easy and John ,  having been in New York now for nearly three weeks without any  encouragement from the fates , was near the breaking point . A gray  apathy had succeeded the frenzied restlessness of the first few days .  The necessity for some kind of work that would

When the damsels had informed him , he thanked them for all their  kindness,--for the bread and grapes with which they had fed him , the  lovely flowers with which they had crowned him , and the songs and  dances wherewith they had done him honor,--and he thanked them , most  of all , for telling him the right way,--and immediately set forth upon  his journey .  But , before he was out of hearing , one of the maidens called after  him .  "" Keep fast hold of the Old One , when you catch him !

Only hold him fast ,  and he will tell you what you wish to know . ""  Hercules again thanked her , and pursued his way , while the maidens  resumed their pleasant labor of making flower - wreaths . They talked  about the hero , long after he was gone .

You laughed at these words , and  others around us laughed as well ; I heard them . Very likely I expressed  myself funnily , and I may have looked funny , but , for all that , I  believe I understand where honour lies , and what I said was but the  literal truth . You were about to ruin yourself just now , irrevocably ;  you would never have forgiven yourself for so doing afterwards ; and  yet , you are absolutely blameless . It is impossible that your life  should be altogether ruined at your age . What matter that Rogojin came  bargaining here , and that Gavrila Ardalionovitch would have deceived  you if he could ? Why do you continually remind us of these facts ? I  assure you once more that very few could find it in them to act as you  have acted this day . As for your wish to go with Rogojin , that was  simply the idea of a delirious and suffering brain . You are still quite  feverish ; you ought to be in bed , not here . You know quite well that if  you had gone with Rogojin , you would have become a washer - woman next  day , rather than stay with him . You are proud , Nastasia Philipovna , and  perhaps you have really suffered so much that you imagine yourself to  be a desperately guilty woman . You require a great deal of petting and  looking after , Nastasia Philipovna , and I will do this . I saw your  portrait this morning , and it seemed quite a familiar face to me ; it  seemed to me that the portrait - face was calling to me for help . I — I  shall respect you all my life , Nastasia Philipovna , ” concluded the  prince , as though suddenly recollecting himself , and blushing to think  of the sort of company

"	"Then Dame Lionesse said unto Sir Gareth : Sir , I  will lend you a ring , but I would pray you as you love me heartily let  me have it again when the tournament is done , for that ring increaseth  my beauty much more than it is of himself . And the virtue of my ring is  that , that is green it will turn to red , and that is red it will turn  in likeness to green , and that is blue it will turn to likeness of  white , and that is white it will turn in likeness to blue , and so it  will do of all manner of colours .

Then Sir Gringamore gave Sir Gareth  a bay courser that was a passing good horse ; also he gave him good  armour and sure , and a noble sword that sometime Sir Gringamore ’s  father won upon an heathen tyrant .

"	"The Marionette walked swiftly  along the road to the village . But the poor fellow hardly knew what  he was about . He thought he had a nightmare . He felt ill . His eyes saw  everything double , his legs trembled , his tongue was dry , and , try as he  might , he could not utter a single word . Yet , in spite of this numbness  of feeling , he suffered keenly at the thought of passing under the  windows of his good little Fairy ’s house . What would she say on seeing  him between two Carabineers ?  They had just reached the village , when a sudden gust of wind blew off  Pinocchio ’s cap and made it go sailing far down the street .  “ Would you allow me , ” the Marionette asked the Carabineers , “ to run  after my cap ? ”  “ Very well , go ; but hurry . ”  The Marionette went , picked up his cap -- but instead of putting it on his  head , he stuck it between his teeth and then raced toward the sea .  He went like a bullet out of a gun .  The Carabineers , judging that it would be very difficult to catch him ,  sent a large Mastiff after him , one that had won first prize in all the  dog races . Pinocchio ran fast and the Dog ran faster . At so much noise ,  the people hung out of the windows or gathered in the street , anxious to  see the end of the contest . But they were disappointed , for the Dog and  Pinocchio raised so much dust on the road that , after a few moments , it  was impossible to see them .  CHAPTER 28  Pinocchio runs the danger of being fried in a pan like a fish  During that wild chase , Pinocchio lived through a terrible moment when  he almost gave himself up as lost . This was when Alidoro ( that was the  Mastiff ’s name ) , in a frenzy of running , came so near that he was on the  very point of reaching him .  The Marionette heard , close behind him , the labored breathing of the  beast who was fast on his trail , and now and again even felt his hot  breath blow over him .  Luckily , by this time , he was very near the shore , and the sea was in  sight ; in fact , only a few short steps away .  As soon as he set foot on the beach , Pinocchio gave a leap and fell into  the water . Alidoro tried to stop , but as he was running

"<fairy> ""  Miss St. John 's chief trouble in life was that she had a clever father .
"	" Sometimes this seemed to her a dreadful calamity .   If you have a father  who knows everything , who speaks seven or eight languages , and has  thousands of volumes which he has apparently learned by heart , he  frequently expects you to be familiar with the contents of your lesson  books at least ; and it is not improbable that he will feel you ought to  be able to remember a few incidents of history and to write a French  exercise .   Ermengarde was a severe trial to Mr. St. John . He could not  understand how a child of his could be a notably and unmistakably dull  creature who never shone in anything .  "" Good heavens ! "" he had said more than once , as he stared at her , "" there  are times when I think she is as stupid as her Aunt Eliza ! ""  If her Aunt Eliza had been slow to learn and quick to forget a thing  entirely when she had learned it , Ermengarde was strikingly like her .  She was the monumental dunce of the school , and it could not be denied .  "" She must be MADE to learn , "" her father said to Miss Minchin .  Consequently Ermengarde spent the greater part of her life in disgrace  or in tears .   She learned things and forgot them ; or , if she remembered  them , she did not understand them .   So it was natural that , having made  Sara 's acquaintance , she should sit and stare at her with profound  admiration .  "" You can speak French , ca n't you ? "" she said respectfully .  Sara got on to the window - seat , which was a big , deep one , and , tucking  up her feet , sat with her hands clasped round her knees .  "" I can speak it because I have heard it all my life , "" she answered .  "" You could speak it if you had always heard it . ""  "" Oh , no , I could n't , "" said Ermengarde .   "" I NEVER could speak it ! ""  "" Why ? "" inquired Sara , curiously .  Ermengarde shook her head so that the pigtail wobbled .  "" You heard me just now , "" she said .   "" I 'm always like that . I ca n't SAY  the words .   They 're so queer . ""  She paused a moment , and then added with a touch of awe in her voice ,  "" You are CLEVER , are n't you ?

"<fantasy> In addition ,  I loaded , and slipped into my pocket , a small , but heavy , pistol .
"	"I  quite understood that , if there were any danger , it lay in the direction  of the Pit and I intended to be prepared .  Leaving the study , I went down to the back door , followed by Pepper .  Once outside , I took a quick survey of the surrounding gardens , and then  set off toward the Pit . On the way , I kept a sharp outlook , holding my  gun , handily . Pepper was running ahead , I noticed , without any apparent  hesitation . From this , I augured that there was no imminent danger to be  apprehended , and I stepped out more quickly in his wake . He had reached  the top of the Pit , now , and was nosing his way along the edge .  A minute later , I was beside him , looking down into the Pit . For a  moment , I could scarcely believe that it was the same place , so greatly  was it changed . The dark , wooded ravine of a fortnight ago , with a  foliage - hidden stream , running sluggishly , at the bottom , existed no  longer . Instead , my eyes showed me a ragged chasm , partly filled with a  gloomy lake of turbid water . All one side of the ravine was stripped of  underwood , showing the bare rock .  A little to my left , the side of the Pit appeared to have collapsed  altogether , forming a deep V - shaped cleft in the face of the rocky  cliff . This rift ran , from the upper edge of the ravine , nearly down to  the water , and penetrated into the Pit side , to a distance of some forty  feet . Its opening was , at least , six yards across ; and , from this , it  seemed to taper into about two . But , what attracted my attention , more  than even the stupendous split itself , was a great hole , some distance  down the cleft , and right in the angle of the V. It was clearly defined ,  and not unlike an arched doorway in shape ; though , lying as it did in  the shadow , I could not see it very distinctly .  The opposite side of the Pit , still retained its verdure ; but so torn  in places , and everywhere covered with dust and rubbish , that it was  hardly distinguishable as such .  My first impression , that there had been a land slip , was , I began to  see , not sufficient , of itself , to account for all the changes I  witnessed . And the water-- ? I turned , suddenly

"<fairy> And whenever the cross touched his  lips , the eyes would open for a moment , and the legs moved once , and he  kissed the cross greedily , hurriedly — just as though he were anxious to  catch hold of something in case of its being useful to him afterwards ,  though he could hardly have had any connected religious thoughts at the  time .
"	"And so up to the very block .  “ How strange that criminals seldom swoon at such a moment ! On the  contrary , the brain is especially active , and works  incessantly — probably hard , hard , hard — like an engine at full pressure .  I imagine that various thoughts must beat loud and fast through his  head — all unfinished ones , and strange , funny thoughts , very  likely!—like this , for instance : ‘ That man is looking at me , and he has  a wart on his forehead ! and the executioner has burst one of his  buttons , and the lowest one is all rusty ! ’ And meanwhile he notices and  remembers everything . There is one point that can not be forgotten ,  round which everything else dances and turns about ; and because of this  point he can not faint , and this lasts until the very final quarter of a  second , when the wretched neck is on the block and the victim listens  and waits and _ knows_—that ’s the point , he _ knows _ that he is just  _ now _ about to die , and listens for the rasp of the iron over his head .  If I lay there , I should certainly listen for that grating sound , and  hear it , too ! There would probably be but the tenth part of an instant  left to hear it in , but one would certainly hear it . And imagine , some  people declare that when the head flies off it is _ conscious _ of having  flown off ! Just imagine what a thing to realize ! Fancy if consciousness  were to last for even five seconds !  “ Draw the scaffold so that only the top step of the ladder comes in  clearly . The criminal must be just stepping on to it , his face as white  as note - paper . The priest is holding the cross to his blue lips , and  the criminal kisses it , and knows and sees and understands everything .  The cross and the head — there ’s your picture ; the priest and the  executioner , with his two assistants , and a few heads and eyes below .  Those might come in as subordinate accessories — a sort of mist . There ’s  a picture for you . ” The prince paused , and looked around .  “ Certainly that is n’t much like quietism , ” murmured Alexandra , half to  herself .  “ Now tell us about your love affairs , ” said Adelaida , after a moment ’s  pause .  The prince gazed at her in amazement .  “ You know , ”

When it was full , the prince  cried out , "" Stop , bowl , "" and the bowl stopped filling . "" See , aunty , ""  he said , "" with this bowl I can always get as much water as I want .

"	" Considering the want of experience in the new tenants , matters went on  remarkably well . Mrs. Fluker , accustomed to rise from her couch long  before the lark , managed to the satisfaction of all,--regular  boarders , single - meal takers , and transient people . Marann went to the  village school , her mother dressing her , though with prudent economy ,  as neatly and almost as tastefully as any of her schoolmates ; while ,  as to study , deportment , and general progress , there was not a girl in  the whole school to beat her , I do n't care who she was .  II  During a not inconsiderable period Mr. Fluker indulged the honorable  conviction that at last he had found the vein in which his best  talents lay , and he was happy in foresight of the prosperity and  felicity which that discovery promised to himself and his family . His  native activity found many more objects for its exertion than before .  He rode out to the farm , not often , but sometimes , as a matter of  duty , and was forced to acknowledge that Sam was managing better than  could have been expected in the absence of his own continuous  guidance . In town he walked about the hotel , entertained the guests ,  carved at the meals , hovered about the stores , the doctors ' offices ,  the wagon and blacksmith shops , discussed mercantile , medical ,  mechanical questions with specialists in all these departments ,  throwing into them all more and more of politics as the intimacy  between him and his patron and chief boarder increased .  Now as to that patron and chief boarder . The need of extending his  acquaintance seemed to press upon Mr. Pike with ever - increasing  weight . He was here and there , all over the county ; at the  county - seat , at the county villages , at justices ' courts , at  executors ' and administrators ' sales , at quarterly and protracted  religious meetings , at barbecues of every dimension , on hunting  excursions and fishing frolics , at social parties in all  neighborhoods . It got to be said of Mr. Pike that a freer acceptor of  hospitable invitations , or a better appreciator of hospitable  intentions , was not and needed not to be found possibly in the whole  state . Nor was this admirable deportment confined to the county in  which he held so high official position . He attended , among other  occasions less public , the spring sessions of the supreme and county  courts in the four adjoining counties : the guest of acquaintance old  and new over there . When

What I mean is — I thought you usually dined  with him before you went to the theatre . ”  “ I ’ve left the stage now . ”  Suddenly the whole thing dawned on me . I had forgotten what a long time  I had been away .  “ Why , of course , I see now ! You ’re married ! ”  “ Yes . ”  “ How perfectly topping ! I wish you all kinds of happiness . ”  “ Thank you , so much . Oh Alexander , ” she said , looking past me , “ this is  a friend of mine — Mr . Wooster . ”  I spun round . A chappie with a lot of stiff grey hair and a red sort of  healthy face was standing there . Rather a formidable Johnnie , he  looked , though quite peaceful at the moment .  “ I want you to meet my husband , Mr. Wooster .

"<fairy>  Edmund crept slowly out and saw the dragon stretching herself on the  rocks in the sun , and he crept past the great creature and tore down the  hill into the town and burst into school , crying out : "" There 's a great  dragon coming ! Somebody ought to do something , or we shall all be  destroyed .
"	"""  He was caned for untruthfulness without any delay . His master was never  one for postponing a duty .  "" But it 's true , "" said Edmund . "" You just see if it is n't . ""  He pointed out of the window , and everyone could see a vast yellow cloud  rising up into the air above the mountain .  "" It 's only a thunder shower , "" said the master , and caned Edmund more  than ever . This master was not like some masters I know : He was very  obstinate , and would not believe his own eyes if they told him anything  different from what he had been saying before his eyes spoke .  So while the master was writing _ Lying is very wrong , and liars must be  caned . It is all for their own good _ on the black - board for Edmund to  copy out seven hundred times , Edmund sneaked out of school and ran for  his life across the town to warn his granny , but she was not at home . So  then he made off through the back door of the town , and raced up the  hill to tell the cockatrice and ask for his help . It never occurred to  him that the cockatrice might not believe him . You see , he had heard so  many wonderful tales from him and had believed them all -- and when you  believe all a person 's stories they ought to believe yours . This is only  fair .  At the mouth of the cockatrice 's cave Edmund stopped , very much out of  breath , to look back at the town . As he ran he had felt his little legs  tremble and shake , while the shadows of the great yellow cloud fell upon  him . Now he stood once more between warm earth and blue sky , and looked  down on the green plain dotted with fruit trees and red - roofed farms  and plots of gold corn . In the middle of that plain the gray town lay ,  with its strong walls with the holes pierced for the archers , and its  square towers with holes for dropping melted lead on the heads of  strangers ; its bridges and its steeples ; the quiet river edged with  willow and alder ; and the pleasant green garden place in the middle of  the town , where people sat on holidays to smoke their pipes and listen  to the band .  Edmund saw it all ; and he saw , too , creeping across the plain , marking  her way by a black line as everything withered at her touch , the great  yellow dragon

"<fantasy> Among  so many streets as there are in the city it is little wonder that  there is one that has never been seen before ; it is named Go - by Street  and runs out of the Strand if you look very closely .
"	"  Now when you  enter this man 's shop you do not go straight to the point but you ask  him to sell you something , and if it is anything with which he can  supply you he hands it you and wishes you good - morning .   It is his  way .   And many have been deceived by asking for some unlikely thing ,  such as the oyster - shell from which was taken one of those single  pearls that made the gates of Heaven in Revelations , and finding that  the old man had it in stock .  He was comatose when I went into the shop , his heavy lids almost  covered his little eyes ; he sat , and his mouth was open .   I said , "" I  want some of Abama and Pharpah , rivers of Damascus . ""   "" How much ? "" he  said .   "" Two and a half yards of each , to be delivered to my flat . ""  "" That is very tiresome , "" he muttered , "" very tiresome .   We do not stock  it in that quantity . ""   "" Then I will take all you have , "" I said .  He rose laboriously and looked among some bottles .   I saw one  labelled : Nilos , river of Ægyptos ; and others Holy Ganges , Phlegethon ,  Jordan ; I was almost afraid he had it , when I heard him mutter again ,  "" This is very tiresome , "" and presently he said , "" We are out of it . ""  "" Then , "" I said , "" I wish you to tell me the way to those little  cottages in whose upper chambers poets look out upon the fields we  know not , for I wish to go into the Land of Dream and to sail once  more upon mighty , sea - like Yann . ""  At that he moved heavily and slowly in way - worn carpet slippers ,  panting as he went , to the back part of his shop , and I went with him .  This was a dingy lumber - room full of idols : the near end was dingy and  dark but at the far end was a blue cærulean glow in which stars seemed  to be shining and the heads of the idols glowed . "" This , "" said the fat  old man in carpet slippers , "" is the heaven of the gods who sleep .

"<fantasy> How Sir Tristram departed from the king and La Beale Isoud  out of Ireland for to come into Cornwall .
"	" Sir , said Tristram , now I shall tell you all the truth : my father ’s  name is Sir Meliodas , King of Liones , and my mother hight Elizabeth ,  that was sister unto King Mark of Cornwall ; and my mother died of me in  the forest , and because thereof she commanded , or she died , that when I  were christened they should christen me Tristram ; and because I would  not be known in this country I turned my name and let me call  Tramtrist ; and for the truage of Cornwall I fought for my eme ’s sake ,  and for the right of Cornwall that ye had posseded many years . And wit  ye well , said Tristram unto the king , I did the battle for the love of  mine uncle , King Mark , and for the love of the country of Cornwall , and  for to increase mine honour ; for that same day that I fought with Sir  Marhaus I was made knight , and never or then did I battle with no  knight , and from me he went alive , and left his shield and his sword  behind .  So God me help , said the king , I may not say but ye did as a knight  should , and it was your part to do for your quarrel , and to increase  your worship as a knight should ; howbeit I may not maintain you in this  country with my worship , unless that I should displease my barons , and  my wife and her kin . Sir , said Tristram , I thank you of your good  lordship that I have had with you here , and the great goodness my lady ,  your daughter , hath shewed me , and therefore , said Sir Tristram , it may  so happen that ye shall win more by my life than by my death , for in  the parts of England it may happen I may do you service at some season ,  that ye shall be glad that ever ye shewed me your good lordship . With  more I promise you as I am true knight , that in all places I shall be  my lady your daughter ’s servant and knight in right and in wrong , and I  shall never fail her , to do as much as a knight may do . Also I beseech  your good grace that I may take my leave at my lady , your daughter , and  at all the barons and knights . I will well , said the king .  Then Sir Tristram went unto La Beale Isoud and took his leave of her .  And then he told her all ,

"	"A word in earnest is as  good as a speech . I am heartily glad to see you . You are at home . Warm  yourself ! ""  While he spoke I glanced at his face . It was a handsome face , full of  change and motion ; and his hair was a silvered iron grey . I took him to  be nearer sixty than fifty , but he was upright , hearty , and robust .  So this was our coming to Bleak House .  The very next morning I was installed as housekeeper and presented with  two bunches of keys -- a large bunch for the housekeeping and a little  bunch for the cellars . I could not help trembling when I met Mr.  Jarndyce , for I knew it was he who had done everything for me since my  godmother 's death .  "" Nonsense ! "" he said . "" I hear of a good little orphan girl without a  protector , and I take it into my head to be that protector . She grows  up , and more than justifies my good opinion , and I remain her guardian  and her friend . What is there in all this ?

"" Of course , Esther , "" he said , "" you do n't understand this Chancery  business ? ""  I shook my head .  "" I do n't know who does , "" he returned . "" The lawyers have twisted it into  such a state of bedevilment that the original merits of the case have  long disappeared . Its about a will , and the trusts under a will -- or it  was once .

In the question how the trusts under that  will are to be administered , the fortune left by the will is squandered  away ; the legatees under the will are reduced to such a miserable  condition that they would be sufficiently punished if they had committed  an enormous crime in having money left them , and the will itself is made  a dead letter . All through the deplorable cause everybody must have  copies , over and over again , of everything that has accumulated about it  in the way of cartloads of papers , and must go down the middle and up  again , through such an infernal country - dance of

"<fairy> Luckily  for Perseus , their faces were completely hidden from him by the  posture in which they lay ; for , had he but looked one instant at them ,  he would have fallen heavily out of the air , an image of senseless  stone .
"	" "" Now , "" whispered Quicksilver , as he hovered by the side of  Perseus,--""now is your time to do the deed ! Be quick ; for , if one of  the Gorgons should awake , you are too late ! ""  "" Which shall I strike at ? "" asked Perseus , drawing his sword and  descending a little lower . "" They all three look alike . All three have  snaky locks . Which of the three is Medusa ? ""  It must be understood that Medusa was the only one of these  dragon - monsters whose head Perseus could possibly cut off . As for the  other two , let him have the sharpest sword that ever was forged , and  he might have hacked away by the hour together , without doing them the  least harm .  "" Be cautious , "" said the calm voice which had before spoken to him .  "" One of the Gorgons is stirring in her sleep , and is just about to  turn over . That is Medusa . Do not look at her ! The sight would turn  you to stone ! Look at the reflection of her face and figure in the  bright mirror of your shield . ""  Perseus now understood Quicksilver 's motive for so earnestly  exhorting him to polish his shield . In its surface he could safely  look at the reflection of the Gorgon 's face . And there it was,--that  terrible countenance,--mirrored in the brightness of the shield , with  the moonlight falling over it , and displaying all its horror . The  snakes , whose venomous natures could not altogether sleep , kept  twisting themselves over the forehead . It was the fiercest and most  horrible face that ever was seen or imagined , and yet with a strange ,  fearful , and savage kind of beauty in it . The eyes were closed , and  the Gorgon was still in a deep slumber ; but there was an unquiet  expression disturbing her features , as if the monster was troubled  with an ugly dream . She gnashed her white tusks , and dug into the sand  with her brazen claws .  The snakes , too , seemed to feel Medusa 's dream , and to be made more  restless by it . They twined themselves into tumultuous knots , writhed  fiercely , and uplifted a hundred hissing heads , without opening their  eyes .  "" Now , now !

Wherefore anyone who beholdeth them , feareth them . ""  "" Grammercy for thy thought of me , good fellow , "" quoth Sir Launcelot , "" but  if I shall refuse an adventure because I find it perilous , then I am not  like to undertake any adventure at all . ""  Therewith he bade good den to that yeoman and rode upon his way , directing  his course toward that town at an easy pass .  So he came at last to the long bridge that reached from the land to the  island , and he saw that at the farther end of the bridge was the gateway of  the town and through the arch thereof he could perceive a street of the  town , and the houses upon either side of the street , and the people thereof  coming and going .  [ Sidenote : Sir Launcelot crosses the bridge to the town ] So he rode forth  upon the bridge and at the noise of his coming ( for the hoofs of his horse  sounded like thunder upon the floor of the bridge ) the people of the town  came running to see who it was that dared to come so boldly into their  town .  These , when Sir Launcelot came nigh , began to call to him on high , crying :  "" Turn back , Sir Knight ! Turn back ! Else you will meet your death at this  place . ""  But Sir Launcelot would not turn back , but advanced very steadfastly upon  his way .  Now somewhat nigh the farther end of that bridge there stood a little lodge  of stone , built to shelter the warden of the bridge from stress of weather .  When Sir Launcelot came nigh to this lodge there started suddenly out from  it a great churl , above seven feet high , who bore in his hand a huge club ,  shod with iron and with great spikes of iron at the top . This churl ran to  Sir Launcelot and catched his horse by the bridle - rein and thrust it back  upon its haunches , crying out in a great hoarse voice : "" Whither goest thou ,  Sir Knight , for to cross this bridge ?

It is so pleasant that we spend  our evenings talking there when too tired with our day ’s work to go  out . Fred is very entertaining , and is altogether the most agreeable  young man I ever knew — except Laurie , whose manners are more charming . I  wish Fred was dark , for I do n’t fancy light men , however , the Vaughns  are very rich and come of an excellent family , so I wo n’t find fault  with their yellow hair , as my own is yellower .  Next week we are off to Germany and Switzerland , and as we shall travel  fast , I shall only be able to give you hasty letters .

At Coblentz we had a lovely  time , for some students from Bonn , with whom Fred got acquainted on the  boat , gave us a serenade . It was a moonlight night , and about one  o’clock Flo and I were waked by the most delicious music under our  windows . We flew up , and hid behind the curtains , but sly peeps showed  us Fred and the students singing away down below . It was the most  romantic thing I ever saw — the river , the bridge of boats , the great  fortress opposite , moonlight everywhere , and music fit to melt a heart  of stone .  When they were done we threw down some flowers , and saw them scramble  for them , kiss their hands to the invisible ladies , and go laughing  away , to smoke and drink beer , I suppose . Next morning Fred showed me  one of the crumpled flowers in his vest pocket , and looked very  sentimental .

"	" "" Why , how can a tiny fish help such a great girl as I am ? "" laughed Rosy .  "" Wait and see , "" answered the fish , as he swam away with a flap of his  little tail .  Rosy went on her way , and forgot all about it . But she never forgot  to be kind ; and soon after , as she was looking in the grass for  strawberries , she found a field - mouse with a broken leg .  "" Help me to my nest , or my babies will starve , "" cried the poor thing .  "" Yes , I will ; and bring these berries so that you can keep still till  your leg is better , and have something to eat . ""  Rosy took the mouse carefully in her little hand , and tied up the broken  leg with a leaf of spearmint and a blade of grass . Then she carried her  to the nest under the roots of an old tree , where four baby mice were  squeaking sadly for their mother . She made a bed of thistledown for the  sick mouse , and put close within reach all the berries and seeds she  could find , and brought an acorn - cup of water from the spring , so they  could be comfortable .  "" Good little Rosy , I shall pay you for all this kindness some day , "" said  the mouse , when she was done .  "" I 'm afraid you are not big enough to do much , "" answered Rosy , as she  ran off to go on her journey .  "" Wait and see , "" called the mouse ; and all the little ones squeaked , as  if they said the same .  Some time after , as Rosy lay up in a tree , waiting for the sun to rise ,  she heard a great buzzing close by , and saw a fly caught in a cobweb  that went from one twig to another . The big spider was trying to spin  him all up , and the poor fly was struggling to get away before his legs  and wings were helpless .  Rosy put up her finger and pulled down the web , and the spider ran away  at once to hide under the leaves . But the happy fly sat on Rosy 's hand ,  cleaning his wings , and buzzing so loud for joy that it sounded like a  little trumpet .

Nay , but by the Hallows , this new - comer is the first one ,  and the one who chattered at me is the second .

Then he raised his  arm and cast the weapon far into the bushes of the bank - side , and then  came forward and stood before Birdalone , and drew down her hands from her  face and stared in the eyes of her , holding her by the two arms ; and he  said : Thou hast forgotten now , belike , how fair a life we two might have  lived if thou hadst not fled from me and spoiled me .  And thou ! by the looks of thee , for thou art sleek and fair , though this  moment thou art pale for fear of me , thou hast lived a happy life through  all these years , with many a merry thing to think of : and dost thou deem  that my life was happy , or that I thought of any merry thing , or of  anything save my sorrow ?   Dost thou doubt it ? go ask the good spears of  Greenford , or the Riders of the Red Hold , and the field of the slaughter !  If there was little joy there , less was there elsewhere .  He left go of her therewith and stood trembling before her , and she bowed  down and put palm to palm and held them out to him as one who prays ; and  she knew not what she did .  Then he cried out with a lamentable cry and said : O woe ’s me ! for I have  frighted her and scared the wit out of her , so that she knows not who I  am nor what I would ; and I would pray to her and beseech her to pity me ,  and not depart from me again or mock me with images of herself .

"<fairy>  Marianne could speak _ her _ happiness only by tears .
"	"Comparisons would  occur — regrets would arise ; and her joy , though sincere as her love for  her sister , was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language .  But Elinor — how are _ her _ feelings to be described ? From the moment of  learning that Lucy was married to another , that Edward was free , to the  moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed , she  was every thing by turns but tranquil . But when the second moment had  passed , when she found every doubt , every solicitude removed , compared  her situation with what so lately it had been,—saw him honourably  released from his former engagement,—saw him instantly profiting by the  release , to address herself and declare an affection as tender , as  constant as she had ever supposed it to be,—she was oppressed , she was  overcome by her own felicity ; and happily disposed as is the human mind  to be easily familiarized with any change for the better , it required  several hours to give sedateness to her spirits , or any degree of  tranquillity to her heart .  Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week;—for whatever  other claims might be made on him , it was impossible that less than a  week should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor ’s company , or  suffice to say half that was to be said of the past , the present , and  the future;—for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of  incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in  common between any two rational creatures , yet with lovers it is  different . Between _ them _ no subject is finished , no communication is  even made , till it has been made at least twenty times over .  Lucy ’s marriage , the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all ,  formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;—and  Elinor ’s particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in  every view , as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable  circumstances she had ever heard . How they could be thrown together ,  and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl , of  whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration,—a  girl too already engaged to his brother , and on whose account that  brother had been thrown off by his family — it was beyond her  comprehension to make out . To her own heart it was a delightful affair ,  to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one , but to her reason , her

"<fairy>  As the type of the FOLIO I present the _ Sperm Whale _ ; of the OCTAVO ,  the _ Grampus _ ; of the DUODECIMO , the _ Porpoise _ .
"	" FOLIOS . Among these I here include the following chapters:—I. The  _ Sperm Whale _ ; II . the _ Right Whale _ ; III . the _ Fin - Back Whale _ ; IV .  the _ Hump - backed Whale _ ; V. the _ Razor Back Whale _ ; VI . the _ Sulphur  Bottom Whale _ .  BOOK I. ( _ Folio _ ) , CHAPTER I. ( _ Sperm Whale_).—This whale , among the  English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale , and the Physeter  whale , and the Anvil Headed whale , is the present Cachalot of the  French , and the Pottsfich of the Germans , and the Macrocephalus of the  Long Words . He is , without doubt , the largest inhabitant of the globe ;  the most formidable of all whales to encounter ; the most majestic in  aspect ; and lastly , by far the most valuable in commerce ; he being the  only creature from which that valuable substance , spermaceti , is  obtained . All his peculiarities will , in many other places , be enlarged  upon . It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do . Philologically  considered , it is absurd . Some centuries ago , when the Sperm whale was  almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality , and when his oil  was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish ; in those days  spermaceti , it would seem , was popularly supposed to be derived from a  creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland  or Right Whale . It was the idea also , that this same spermaceti was  that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable  of the word literally expresses . In those times , also , spermaceti was  exceedingly scarce , not being used for light , but only as an ointment  and medicament . It was only to be had from the druggists as you  nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb . When , as I opine , in the course of  time , the true nature of spermaceti became known , its original name was  still retained by the dealers ; no doubt to enhance its value by a  notion so strangely significant of its scarcity . And so the appellation  must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this  spermaceti was really derived .  BOOK I. ( _ Folio _ ) , CHAPTER II . ( _ Right Whale_).—In one respect this is  the most venerable of the leviathans , being the one first regularly  hunted by man . It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or  baleen ; and the oil specially

"" Well , I have heard , "" says Jurgen , "" that you have a notable  residence in Cocaigne . ""  "" But that is only a little country place , to which I sometimes  repair in summer , in order to live rustically . No , Jurgen , you must  see my palaces . In Babylon I have a palace where many abide with  cords about them and burn bran for perfume , while they await that  thing which is to befall them . In Armenia I have a palace surrounded  by vast gardens , where only strangers have the right to enter : they  there receive a hospitality that is more than gallant . In Paphos I  have a palace wherein is a little pyramid of white stone , very  curious to see : but still more curious is the statue in my palace at  Amathus , of a bearded woman , which displays other features that  women do not possess . And in Alexandria I have a palace that is  tended by thirty - six exceedingly wise and sacred persons , and  wherein it is always night : and there folk seek for monstrous  pleasures , even at the price of instant death , and win to both of  these swiftly . Everywhere my palaces stand upon high places near the  sea : so they are beheld from afar by those whom I hold dearest , my  beautiful broad - chested mariners , who do not fear even me , but know  that in my palaces they will find notable employment .

Now he listened more attentively than ever , and his eyes were  narrowed , and his lips were lax and motionless and foolish - looking ,  and he was deeply interested .

To these  persons they complained with somewhat unreasoning acrimony that I  had been exciting the inmates into a state of rebellion with wild  imaginings , and for the first time I then began to understand that an  important error had been perpetrated by some one , and that instead of  being a meeting - place for those upholding the wisdom and authority  of the country , the building was in reality an establishment for the  mentally defective and those of treacherous instincts .  For some time after this occurrence I failed to regard the subject of  demons and allied Forces in any but a spirit of complete no enthusiasm ,  but more recently my interest and research have been enlarged by the  zeal and supernatural conversation of a liberal - minded person who  sought my prosaic society with indefatigable persistence . When we had  progressed to such a length that the one might speak of affairs without  the other at once interposing that he himself had also unfortunately  come out quite destitute of money , this stranger , who revealed to me  that his name was Glidder , but that in the company of a certain chosen  few he was known intimately as the Keeper of the Salograma , approached  me confidentially , and inquired whether we of our Central Kingdom were  in the habit of receiving manifestations from the spirits of those who  had Passed Beyond .  At the unassumed ingenuousness of this remark I suffered my  impassiveness to relax , as I replied with well - established pride that  although a country which neglected its ancestors might doubtless be  able to produce more of the ordinary or graveyard spectres , we were  unapproachable for the diverse forms and malignant enmity of our  apparitions . Of invisible beings alone , I continued tolerantly , we  had the distinction of being harassed by upwards of seven hundred  clearly - defined varieties , while the commoner inflictions of demons ,  shades , visions , warlocks , phantoms , sprites , imps , phenomena , ghosts ,  and reflections passed almost without comment ; and touching our admitted  national speciality of dragons , the honour of supremacy had never been  questioned .

"	"As  they drew near , the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool ,  the pail , and even the milkmaid herself , and all fell on the china  ground with a great clatter .  Dorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off , and  that the pail was lying in several small pieces , while the poor  milkmaid had a nick in her left elbow .  “ There ! ” cried the milkmaid angrily . “ See what you have done ! My cow  has broken her leg , and I must take her to the mender ’s shop and have  it glued on again . What do you mean by coming here and frightening my  cow ? ”  “ I ’m very sorry , ” returned Dorothy . “ Please forgive us . ”  But the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer . She  picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away , the poor animal limping  on three legs . As she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful  glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers , holding her nicked  elbow close to her side .  Dorothy was quite grieved at this mishap .  “ We must be very careful here , ” said the kind - hearted Woodman , “ or we  may hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it . ”  A little farther on Dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young  Princess , who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run  away .  Dorothy wanted to see more of the Princess , so she ran after her . But  the china girl cried out :  “ Do n’t chase me ! Do n’t chase me ! ”  She had such a frightened little voice that Dorothy stopped and said ,  “ Why not ? ”  “ Because , ” answered the Princess , also stopping , a safe distance away ,  “ if I run I may fall down and break myself . ”  “ But could you not be mended ? ” asked the girl .  “ Oh , yes ; but one is never so pretty after being mended , you know , ”  replied the Princess .  “ I suppose not , ” said Dorothy .  “ Now there is Mr. Joker , one of our clowns , ” continued the china lady ,  “ who is always trying to stand upon his head . He has broken himself so  often that he is mended in a hundred places , and does n’t look at all  pretty . Here he comes now , so you can see for yourself .

Into this boat Kithneb descended , not heeding words from us , and  onward rowed alone . A cry of triumph over ships and men Brimdono  uttered before him , but Kithneb ’s eyes were turned toward the forest as  he came behind the gods . Upon his face the twilight beat full from the  haunts of evening to illumine the smiles that grew about his eyes as he  came behind the gods . Him that had found the gods above Their twilit  cliffs , him that had heard Their voices close at last and knew Their  meaning clear , him , from the cheerless world with its doubtings and  prophets that lie , from all hidden meanings , where truth rang clear at  last , Brimdono took . ”  But when Paharn ceased to speak , in the King ’s ears the roar of  Brimdono exulting over ancient triumphs and the whelming of ships  seemed still to ring .

"<fairy>  October 13 , General Van Rensselaer crossed the Niagara River and  attacked the British at Queenstown Heights .
"	"The latter retreated , and  General Brock was killed . General Van Rensselaer went back after the  rest of his troops , but they refused to cross , on the ground that the  general had no right to take them out of the United States , and thus the  troops left in charge at the Heights were compelled to surrender .  These troops who refused to go over and accept a victory already won for  them , because they did n't want to cross the Canadian line , would not  have shied so at the boundary if they had been boodlers , very likely , in  later years .  August 19 occurred the naval fight between the Constitution and  Guerriere , off the Massachusetts coast . The Constitution , called "" Old  Ironsides , "" was commanded by Captain Isaac Hull . The Guerriere was first  to attack , but got no reply until both vessels were very close together ,  when into her starboard Captain Hull poured such a load of hardware  that the Guerriere was soon down by the head and lop - sided on the off  side . She surrendered , but was of no value , being so full of holes that  she would not hold a cargo of railroad - trestles .  The economy used by the early American warriors by land and sea  regarding their ammunition , holding their fire until the enemy was at  arm 's length , was the cause of more than one victory . They were obliged ,  indeed , to make every bullet count in the days when even lead was not  produced here , and powder was imported .  October 13 , the naval fight between the Frolic and Wasp took place , off  the North Carolina coast . The Frolic was an English brig , and she wound  up as most frolics do , with a severe pain and a five - dollar fine . After  the Wasp had called and left her R. S. V. P. cards , the decks of the  Frolic were a sight to behold . There were not enough able - bodied men to  surrender the ship . She was captured by the boarding - crew , but there was  not a man left of her own crew to haul down the colors .  Other victories followed on the sea , and American privateers had more  fun than anybody .  Madison was re - elected , thus showing that his style of administration  suited one and all , and the war was prosecuted at a great rate . It  became a sort of fight with Canada , the latter being supported by  English arms by land and sea . Of course the Americans would have  preferred to

And at last I came to a breach made long ago by earthquake ,  lightning or war : I should have had to go down a thousand feet  to get round it and they would come up with me while I was doing  that , for certain sable apes that I have not mentioned as yet , things  that had tigerish teeth and were born and bred on that wall , had  pursued me all the evening . In any case I could have gone no  farther , nor did I know what the king would do along whose wall  I was climbing . It was time to drop and be done with it or stop and  await those apes .  And then it was that I remembered a pin , thrown carelessly down  out of an evening - tie in another world to the one where grew that  glittering wall , and lying now if no evil chance had removed it on a  chest of drawers by my bed . The apes were very close , and hurrying ,  for they knew my fingers were slipping , and the cruel peaks of those  infernal mountains seemed surer of me than the apes . I reached out  with a desperate effort of will towards where the pin lay on the chest  of drawers . I groped about . I found it ! I ran it into my arm . Saved !

"<fantasy> Only a few among the older  men remembered her ; some of them yet treasured , as these fogies so often  do , a stray fan or an odd glove ; and in bycorners of sundry  time - toughened hearts there lurked the memory of a laughing word or of a  glance or of some such casual bounty , that Patricia Vartrey had accorded  these hearts ' owners when the world was young .
"	" But Agatha Musgrave , likewise , remembered the orphan cousin who had  been reared with her . She had loved Patricia Vartrey ; and , in due time ,  she wrote to Patricia 's daughter,--in stately , antiquated phrases that  astonished the recipient not a little,--and the girl had answered . The  correspondence flourished . And it was not long before Miss Musgrave had  induced her young cousin to visit Lichfield .  Colonel Rudolph Musgrave , be it understood , knew nothing of all this  until the girl was actually on her way . And now , she was to arrive that  afternoon , to domicile herself in his quiet house for two long  weeks -- this utter stranger , look you!--and upset his comfort , ask him  silly questions , expect him to talk to her , and at the end of her visit ,  possibly , present him with some outlandish gimcrack made of cardboard  and pink ribbons , in which she would expect him to keep his papers .

Lichfield at large had pampered him ; many women had loved him ; and above  all , Miss Agatha had spoiled him . After fifteen years of being the pivot  about which the economy of a household revolves , after fifteen years of  being the inevitable person whose approval must be secured before any  domestic alteration , however trivial , may be considered , no mortal man  may hope to remain a paragon of unselfishness .  Colonel Musgrave joyed in the society of women . But he classed  them -- say , with the croquettes adorned with pink paper frills which were  then invariably served at the suppers of the Lichfield German Club,--as  acceptable enough , upon a conscious holiday , but wholly incongruous with  the slippered ease of home . When you had an inclination for feminine  society , you shaved and changed your clothes and thought up an impromptu  or so against emergency , and went forth to seek it . That was natural ;  but to have a petticoated young person infesting your house , hourly , was  as preposterous as ice - cream soda at breakfast .  The metaphor set him off at a tangent . He wondered if this Patricia  person could not ( tactfully ) be induced to take her bath after  breakfast , as Agatha did ? after he had his ? Why , confound the girl , he  was not responsible for there being only one bathroom in the house ! It  was necessary for him to have his bath and be at

We are proud of that roof , all we who belong to that  Mess . We boast of it when we show it to our friends when it is all set  out at night . It has Aldebaran in it , the Bear and Orion , and at the  other end the Southern Cross . Yes we are proud of our roof when it is  at its best .  What am I saying ? I should be talking of bacon . Yes , but there is a way  of cooking it in our Mess that I want to tell you and can not . I 've  tasted bacon there that is n't the same as what you get at the Ritz . And  I want to tell you how that bacon tastes ; and I ca n't so I talk about  stars . But perhaps you are one of us , reader , and then you will  understand . Only why the hell do n't we get back there again where the  Evening Star swings low on the wall of the Mess ?  When they rose from table , when they got up from the earth , and the  frying - pan was slung on Morano 's back , adding grease to the mere  surface of his coat whose texture could hold no more , they pushed on  briskly for they saw no sign of houses , unless what Rodriguez saw now  dimly above a ravine were indeed a house in the mountains .  They had walked from eight till noon without any loitering . They must  have done fifteen miles since the mountains were pale blue . And now ,  every mile they went , on the most awful of the dark ridges the object  Rodriguez saw seemed more and more like a house . Yet neither then , nor  as they drew still nearer , nor when they saw it close , nor looking back  on it after years , did it somehow seem quite right . And Morano  sometimes crossed himself as he looked at it , and said nothing .  Rodriguez , as they walked ceaselessly through the afternoon , seeing his  servant show some sign of weariness , which comes not to youth , pointed  out the house looking nearer than it really was on the mountain , and  told him that he should find there straw , and they would sup and stay  the night .

It was a rather pretty little picture , for the sisters sat together in  the shady nook , with sun and shadow flickering over them , the aromatic  wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot cheeks , and all the  little wood people going on with their affairs as if these were no  strangers but old friends . Meg sat upon her cushion , sewing daintily  with her white hands , and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose in her  pink dress among the green . Beth was sorting the cones that lay thick  under the hemlock near by , for she made pretty things with them . Amy  was sketching a group of ferns , and Jo was knitting as she read aloud .  A shadow passed over the boy ’s face as he watched them , feeling that he  ought to go away because uninvited ; yet lingering because home seemed  very lonely and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his  restless spirit . He stood so still that a squirrel , busy with its  harvesting , ran down a pine close beside him , saw him suddenly and  skipped back , scolding so shrilly that Beth looked up , espied the  wistful face behind the birches , and beckoned with a reassuring smile .  “ May I come in , please ? Or shall I be a bother ? ” he asked , advancing  slowly .  Meg lifted her eyebrows , but Jo scowled at her defiantly and said at  once , “ Of course you may . We should have asked you before , only we  thought you would n’t care for such a girl ’s game as this . ”  “ I always like your games , but if Meg does n’t want me , I ’ll go away . ”  “ I ’ve no objection , if you do something .

At that a child came out , to whom he  said , "" Fair child , pray the good man thy master to come hither and let in  a knight who is sore wounded . ""  Anon came out the knight - hermit , whose name was Sir Baldwin , and asked ,  "" Who is this wounded knight ? ""  "" I know not , "" said Sir Lavaine , "" save that he is the noblest knight I ever  met with , and hath done this day such marvellous deeds of arms against  King Arthur that he hath won the prize of the tourney . ""  Then the hermit gazed long on Sir Lancelot , and hardly knew him , so pale  he was with bleeding , yet said he at the last , "" Who art thou , lord ? ""  Sir Lancelot answered feebly , "" I am a stranger knight adventurous , who  laboureth through many realms to win worship . ""  "" Why hidest thou thy name , dear lord , from me ? "" cried Sir Baldwin ; "" for in  sooth I know thee now to be the noblest knight in all the world -- my lord  Sir Lancelot du Lake , with whom I long had fellowship at the Round Table .

"	"Presently , when supper - time came , Bruno had a delicious egg , and  he threw the shell to Felicia , saying :  “ There , that is all I can give you ; if you do n’t like it , go out and  catch frogs ; there are plenty of them in the marsh close by . ” Felicia  did not answer , but she cried more bitterly than ever , and went away  to her own little room . She found it filled with the sweet scent of the  pinks , and , going up to them , she said sadly :  “ Beautiful pinks , you are so sweet and so pretty , you are the only  comfort I have left . Be very sure that I will take care of you , and  water you well , and never allow any cruel hand to tear you from your  stems . ”  As she leaned over them she noticed that they were very dry . So taking  her pitcher , she ran off in the clear moonlight to the fountain , which  was at some distance . When she reached it she sat down upon the brink  to rest , but she had hardly done so when she saw a stately lady coming  toward her , surrounded by numbers of attendants . Six maids of honor  carried her train , and she leaned upon the arm of another .  When they came near the fountain a canopy was spread for her , under  which was placed a sofa of cloth - of - gold , and presently a dainty supper  was served , upon a table covered with dishes of gold and crystal , while  the wind in the trees and the falling water of the fountain murmured the  softest music .  Felicia was hidden in the shade , too much astonished by all she saw to  venture to move ; but in a few moments the Queen said :  “ I fancy I see a shepherdess near that tree ; bid her come hither . ”  So Felicia came forward and saluted the Queen timidly , but with so much  grace that all were surprised .  “ What are you doing here , my pretty child ? ” asked the Queen . “ Are you  not afraid of robbers ? ”  “ Ah ! madam , ” said Felicia , “ a poor shepherdess who has nothing to lose  does not fear robbers . ”  “ You are not very rich , then ? ” said the Queen , smiling .  “ I am so poor , ” answered Felicia , “ that a pot of pinks and a silver ring  are my only possessions in the world . ”  “

And he went not  without being offered the fairest jewels and the fairest horses , and the  choicest dogs ; but he would take none of them .  Thereupon they all remained in their own dominions .   And Pryderi , the son  of Pwyll the Chief of Annwvyn , was brought up carefully as was fit , so  that he became the fairest youth , and the most comely , and the best  skilled in all good games , of any in the kingdom .

"<fantasy> He cheerfully asked Rodriguez how he had  fared on his journey , but Rodriguez would say nothing .
"	"He asked for  lodging for himself and Morano and stabling for the horses : he ate and  slept and paid his due , and in the morning was gone .  Whatever impulses guided Rodriguez as he rode and Morano followed , he  knew not what they were or even that there could be any . He followed  the road without hope and only travelled to change his camping - grounds .  And that night he was half - way between the village and Shadow Valley .  Morano never spoke , for he saw that his master 's disappointment was  still raw ; but it pleased him to notice , as he had done all day , that  they were heading for the great forest . He cooked their evening meal in  their camp by the wayside and they both ate it in silence . For awhile  Rodriguez sat and gazed at the might - have - beens in the camp - fire : and  when these began to be hidden by white ash he went to his blankets and  slept . And Morano went quietly about the little camp , doing all that  needed to be done , with never a word . When the horses were seen to and  fed , when the knives were cleaned , when everything was ready for the  start next morning , Morano went to his blankets and slept too . And in  the morning again they wandered on .  That evening they saw the low gold rays of the sun enchanting the tops  of a forest . It almost surprised Rodriguez , travelling without an aim ,  to recognise Shadow Valley . They quickened their slow pace and , before  twilight faded , they were under the great oaks ; but the last of the  twilight could not pierce the dimness of Shadow Valley , and it seemed  as if night had entered the forest with them .  They chose a camping - ground as well as they could in the darkness and  Morano tied the horses to trees a little way off from the camp . Then he  returned to Rodriguez and tied a blanket to the windward side of two  trees to make a kind of bedroom for his master , for they had all the  blankets they needed . And when this was done he set the emblem and  banner of camps , anywhere all over the world in any time , for he  gathered sticks and branches and lit a camp - fire . The first red flames  went up and waved and proclaimed a camp : the light made a little  circle , shadows ran away to the forest , and the circle of light on the  ground and on the trees that stood round

"<fantasy> Our coverts were mostly on the hills , and as the town came  down upon the valleys the foxes used to leave them and go right away  out of the county and they never returned .
"	"I think they went by night  and moved great distances . Well it was early April and we had drawn  blank all day , and at the last draw of all , the very last of the  season , we found a fox . He left the covert with his back to London and  its railways and villas and wire and slipped away towards the chalk  country and open Kent . I felt as I once felt as a child on one  summer 's day when I found a door in a garden where I played left  luckily ajar , and I pushed it open and the wide lands were before me  and waving fields of corn .  We settled down into a steady gallop and the fields began to drift by  under us , and a great wind arose full of fresh breath . We left the  clay lands where the bracken grows and came to a valley at the edge of  the chalk . As we went down into it we saw the fox go up the other side  like a shadow that crosses the evening , and glide into a wood that  stood on the top . We saw a flash of primroses in the wood and we were  out the other side , hounds hunting perfectly and the fox still going  absolutely straight . It began to dawn on me then that we were in for a  great hunt , I took a deep breath when I thought of it ; the taste of  the air of that perfect Spring afternoon as it came to one galloping ,  and the thought of a great run , were together like some old rare wine .  Our faces now were to another valley , large fields led down to it ,  with easy hedges , at the bottom of it a bright blue stream went  singing and a rambling village smoked , the sunlight on the opposite  slopes danced like a fairy ; and all along the top old woods were  frowning , but they dreamed of Spring . The "" field "" had fallen of and  were far behind and my only human companion was James , my old first  whip , who had a hound 's instinct , and a personal animosity against a  fox that even embittered his speech .  Across the valley the fox went as straight as a railway line , and  again we went without a check straight through the woods at the top . I  remember hearing men sing or shout as they walked home from work , and  sometimes children whistled ; the sounds came up from the village to  the woods at the top of the valley . After that we saw no more  villages ,

"	"  And they had daggers with blades of gold ,  and with hilts of the bone of the whale .   And they were shooting their  daggers .  “ And a little way from them I saw a man in the prime of life , with his  beard newly shorn , clad in a robe and a mantle of yellow satin ; and round  the top of his mantle was a band of gold lace .   On his feet were shoes of  variegated leather , fastened by two bosses of gold .   When I saw him , I  went towards him and saluted him , and such was his courtesy that he no  sooner received my greeting than he returned it .   And he went with me  towards the Castle .   Now there were no dwellers in the Castle except  those who were in one hall .   And there I saw four - and - twenty damsels ,  embroidering satin at a window .   And this I tell thee , Kai , that the  least fair of them was fairer than the fairest maid thou hast ever beheld  in the Island of Britain , and the least lovely of them was more lovely  than Gwenhwyvar , the wife of Arthur , when she has appeared loveliest at  the Offering , on the day of the Nativity , or at the feast of Easter .  They rose up at my coming , and six of them took my horse , and divested me  of my armour ; and six others took my arms , and washed them in a vessel  until they were perfectly bright .   And the third six spread cloths upon  the tables and prepared meat .   And the fourth six took off my soiled  garments , and placed others upon me ; namely , an under - vest and a doublet  of fine linen , and a robe , and a surcoat , and a mantle of yellow satin  with a broad gold band upon the mantle .   And they placed cushions both  beneath and around me , with coverings of red linen ; and I sat down .   Now  the six maidens who had taken my horse , unharnessed him , as well as if  they had been the best squires in the Island of Britain .   Then , behold ,  they brought bowls of silver wherein was water to wash , and towels of  linen , some green and some white ; and I washed .   And in a little while  the man sat down to the table .

"<fairy> ""  "" What prophecy do you mean , dear mother ? "" eagerly inquired Ernest .
"	" "" Pray tell me about it ! ""  So his mother told him a story that her own mother had told to her ,  when she herself was younger than little Ernest ; a story , not of things  that were past , but of what was yet to come ; a story , nevertheless , so  very old , that even the Indians , who formerly inhabited this valley ,  had heard it from their forefathers , to whom , as they affirmed , it had  been murmured by the mountain streams , and whispered by the wind among  the tree - tops . The purport was , that , at some future day , a child  should be born hereabouts , who was destined to become the greatest and  noblest personage of his time , and whose countenance , in manhood ,  should bear an exact resemblance to the Great Stone Face . Not a few  old - fashioned people , and young ones likewise , in the ardor of their  hopes , still cherished an enduring faith in this old prophecy . But  others , who had seen more of the world , had watched and waited till  they were weary , and had beheld no man with such a face , nor any man  that proved to be much greater or nobler than his neighbors , concluded  it to be nothing but an idle tale . At all events , the great man of the  prophecy had not yet appeared .  "" O mother , dear mother ! "" cried Ernest , clapping his hands above his  head , "" I do hope that I shall live to see him ! ""  His mother was an affectionate and thoughtful woman , and felt that it  was wisest not to discourage the generous hopes of her little boy . So  she only said to him , "" Perhaps you may . ""  And Ernest never forgot the story that his mother told him . It was  always in his mind , whenever he looked upon the Great Stone Face . He  spent his childhood in the log - cottage where he was born , and was  dutiful to his mother , and helpful to her in many things , assisting her  much with his little hands , and more with his loving heart . In this  manner , from a happy yet often pensive child , he grew up to be a mild ,  quiet , unobtrusive boy , and sun - browned with labor in the fields , but  with more intelligence brightening his aspect than is seen in many lads  who have been taught at famous schools . Yet Ernest had had no teacher ,  save only that the Great Stone Face

"<fantasy>  Then rose the heart of Hallblithe , and he smote his palms together , and  fell to singing an old song of his people , amidst the rocks whereas few  men had sung aforetime .
"	"    Whence are ye and whither , O fowl of our fathers ?     What field have ye looked on , what acres unshorn ?     What land have ye left where the battle - folk gathers ,     And the war - helms are white o'er the paths of the corn ?     What tale do ye bear of the people uncraven ,     Where amidst the long hall - shadow sparkle the spears ;     Where aloft on the hall - ridge now flappeth the raven ,     And singeth the song of the nourishing years ?     There gather the lads in the first of the morning ,     While white lies the battle - day 's dew on the grass ,     And the kind steeds trot up to the horn 's voice of warning ,     And the winds wake and whine in the dusk of the pass .     O fowl of our fathers , why now are ye resting ?     Come over the mountains and look on the foe .     Full fair after fight won shall yet be your nesting ;     And your fledglings the sons of the kindred shall know .  Therewith he strode with his head upraised , and above him flew the  ravens , croaking as if they answered his song in friendly fashion .  It was but a little after this that the path turned aside sharp toward  the cliffs , and the seekers were abashed thereof , till Hallblithe running  forward beheld a great cavern in the face of the cliff at the path 's  ending : so he turned and cried on his fellows , and they hastened up , and  presently stood before that cavern 's mouth with doubt and joy mingled in  their minds ; for now , mayhappen , they had reached the gate of the  Glittering Plain , or mayhappen the gate of death .  The sad man hung his head and spake : "" Doth not some new trap abide us ?  What do we here ? is this aught save death ? ""  Spake the Elder of Elders : "" Was not death on either hand e'en now , even  as treason besetteth the king upon his throne ? ""  And the second said : "" Yea , we were as the host which hath no road save  through the multitude of foe - men . ""  But Hallblithe laughed and said : "" Why do ye hang back , then ?   As for me ,  if death be here , soon is mine errand sped .

Now will we  begin at Sir Gawaine , that held that way till that he came unto a fair  manor , where dwelled an old knight and a good householder , and there  Sir Gawaine asked the knight if he knew any adventures in that country .  I shall show you some to - morn , said the old knight , and that  marvellous . So , on the morn they rode into the forest of adventures to  a laund , and thereby they found a cross , and as they stood and hoved  there came by them the fairest knight and the seemliest man that ever  they saw , making the greatest dole that ever man made . And then he was  ware of Sir Gawaine , and saluted him , and prayed God to send him much  worship . As to that , said Sir Gawaine , gramercy ; also I pray to God  that he send you honour and worship . Ah , said the knight , I may lay  that aside , for sorrow and shame cometh to me after worship .  CHAPTER XX . How a knight and a dwarf strove for a lady .  And therewith he passed unto the one side of the laund ; and on the  other side saw Sir Gawaine ten knights that hoved still and made them  ready with their shields and spears against that one knight that came  by Sir Gawaine .  Then this one knight aventred a great spear , and one of the ten knights  encountered with him , but this woful knight smote him so hard that he  fell over his horse ’s tail . So this same dolorous knight served them  all , that at the leastway he smote down horse and man , and all he did  with one spear ; and so when they were all ten on foot , they went to  that one knight , and he stood stone still , and suffered them to pull  him down off his horse , and bound him hand and foot , and tied him under  the horse ’s belly , and so led him with them . O Jesu ! said Sir Gawaine ,  this is a doleful sight , to see the yonder knight so to be entreated ,  and it seemeth by the knight that he suffereth them to bind him so , for  he maketh no resistance . No , said his host , that is truth , for an he  would they all were too weak so to do him . Sir , said the damosel unto

"<fantasy>   Now  came the women to them and unarmed them ; and under their armour their  raiment was black ; but they had gold rings on their arms , and golden  collars about their necks .
"	"  So they strode up to the dais and took their  places on the high - seat , not heeding Hallblithe any more than if he were  an image of wood .   Nevertheless that man sat next to him who was the  chieftain of all and sat in the midmost high - seat ; and he bore his  sheathed sword in his hand and laid it on the board before him , and he  was the only man of those chieftains who had a weapon .  But when these were set down there was again a noise without , and there  came in a throng of men armed and unarmed who took their places on the  end - long benches up and down the hall ; with these came women also , who  most of them sat amongst the men , but some busied them with the serving :  all these men were great of stature , but none so big as the chieftains on  the high - seat .  Now came the women in from the kitchen bearing the meat , whereof no  little was flesh - meat , and all was of the best .   Hallblithe was duly  served like the others , but still none spake to him or even looked on  him ; though amongst themselves they spoke in big , rough voices so that  the rafters of the hall rang again .  When they had eaten their fill the women filled round the cups and the  horns to them , and those vessels were both great and goodly .   But ere  they fell to drinking uprose the chieftain who sat furthest from the  midmost high - seat on the right and cried a health : "" THE TREASURE OF THE  SEA ! ""   Then they all stood up and shouted , women as well as men , and  emptied their horns and cups to that health .   Then stood up the man  furthest on the left and cried out , "" Drink a health to the Undying King ! ""  And again all men rose up and shouted ere they drank .   Other healths they  drank , as the "" Cold Keel , "" the "" Windworn Sail , "" the "" Quivering Ash "" and  the "" Furrowed Beach . ""   And the wine and mead flowed like rivers in that  hall of the Wild Men .   As for Hallblithe , he drank what he would but  stood not up , nor raised his cup to his lips when a health was drunk ; for  he knew not whether these men were his friends or his foes , and he deemed  it would be little - minded to drink to their healths , lest he might

""  gasped the King , taking out his lace handkerchief to wipe his eyes ;  for , as he often did , he had laughed till the tears came .  Bilbil was deeply vexed and would not even turn his head to look at his  master . To escape from Rinkitink he wandered among the ruins of the  palace , where he came upon Prince Inga .  "" Good morning , Bilbil , "" said the boy . "" I was just going to find you ,  that I might consult you upon an important matter . If you will kindly  turn back with me I am sure your good judgment will be of great  assistance .

""  "" I am sorry to hear you speak of your kind master in such a way , "" said  the boy gravely . "" All men are deserving of respect , being the highest  of living creatures , and Kings deserve respect more than others , for  they are set to rule over many people . ""  "" Nevertheless , "" said Bilbil with conviction , "" Rinkitink 's head is  certainly empty of brains . ""  "" That I am unwilling to believe , "" insisted Inga . "" But anyway his heart  is kind and gentle and that is better than being wise . He is merry in  spite of misfortunes that would cause others to weep and he never  speaks harsh words that wound the feelings of his friends .

Rinkitink , seeing them turn into the  ruins , also followed , and upon joining them asked for his breakfast .

"<fairy>  And when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the  Rose - tree , and set her breast against the thorn .
"	"All night long she sang  with her breast against the thorn , and the cold crystal Moon leaned down  and listened . All night long she sang and the thorn went deeper and  deeper into her breast , and her life - blood ebbed away from her .  She sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl .  And on the top - most spray of the Rose - tree there blossomed a marvellous  rose , petal following petal , as song followed song . Pale was it , at  first , as the mist that hangs over the river -- pale as the feet of the  morning , and silver as the wings of the dawn . As the shadow of a rose in  a mirror of silver , as the shadow of a rose in a water - pool , so was the  rose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree .

And a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose , like the  flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the  bride . But the thorn had not yet reached her heart , so the rose 's heart  remained white , for only a Nightingale 's heart's - blood can crimson the  heart of a rose .  And the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn .  "" Press closer , little Nightingale , "" cried the Tree , "" or the Day will  come before the rose is finished .

Bitter ,  bitter was the pain , and wilder and wilder grew her song , for she sang  of the Love that is perfected by Death , of the Love that dies not in the  tomb .  And the marvellous rose became crimson , like the rose of the eastern  sky . Crimson was the girdle of petals , and crimson as a ruby was the  heart .  But the Nightingale 's voice grew fainter , and her little wings began to  beat , and a film came over her eyes . Fainter and fainter grew her

Indeed , I would not have come here had I known you were so  close .

Next time I will be very cunning .

When the Alligator found this out , he determined to try and catch the  Jackal on land ; so , going under the largest of the wild fig - trees ,  where the ground was covered with the fallen fruit , he collected a  quantity of it together , and , burying himself under the great heap ,  waited for the Jackal to appear . But no sooner did the cunning little  animal see this great heap of wild figs all collected together than  he thought , "" That looks very like my friend the Alligator . "" And to  discover if it were so or not , he called out : "" The juicy little wild  figs I love to eat always tumble down from the tree , and roll here and  there as the wind drives them ; but this great heap of figs is quite  still ; these can not be good figs ; I will not eat any of them .

I will make the figs roll about a little , then , and when he sees  that , he will doubtless come and eat them .

Seeing this , the Jackal scampered away , saying : "" I am so much obliged  to you , Alligator , for letting me know you are there , for indeed I  should hardly have guessed it . You were so buried under that heap of  figs . "" The Alligator , hearing this , was so angry that he ran

"	"  We took all our hards out of the boat , and hid away under the  roots of an old thorn a little mail wherein was your raiment , my ladies ,  which ye had lent to Birdalone ; then we did on our armour , and advised us  of whereabout on the isle we were , and we saw the orchards and gardens  before us , and the great fair house above all , even as ye told us of  them , Birdalone .  Next , then , without more ado , we went our ways up through the orchard and  the gardens , and when we were well - nigh at the end of them , and in face  of those many steps ye spake of , we saw at the foot of them a tall woman  clad in red scarlet , standing as if she abode our coming .   When we drew  nigh we saw that she was strong - looking , well - knit , white - skinned ,  yellow - haired , and blue - eyed , and might have been called a fair woman , as  to her shaping , save that her face was heavy , yet hard - looking , with thin  lips and somewhat flagging cheeks , a face stupid , but proud and cruel .  She hailed us as we came up , and said : Men - at - arms , ye be welcome to our  house , and I bid you to eat and drink and abide here .  Then we louted before her , and bade her Hail ; and Baudoin said : Lady , thy  bidding will we take ; yet have we an errand to declare ere we break bread  with thee , lest when it is told we be not so welcome as ye tell us now .

And so Sir Palomides  took his horse and his harness , and he rode unto King Arthur ’s court ;  and there Sir Palomides gat him four knights and four  sergeants - of - arms , and so he returned againward unto Joyous Gard . And  in the meanwhile Sir Tristram chased and hunted at all manner of  venery ; and about three days afore the battle should be , as Sir  Tristram chased an hart , there was an archer shot at the hart , and by  misfortune he smote Sir Tristram in the thick of the thigh , and the  arrow slew Sir Tristram ’s horse and hurt him . When Sir Tristram was so  hurt he was passing heavy , and wit ye well he bled sore ; and then he  took another horse , and rode unto Joyous Gard with great heaviness ,  more for the promise that he had made with Sir Palomides , as to do  battle with him within three days after , than for any hurt of his  thigh . Wherefore there was neither man nor woman that could cheer him  with anything that they could make to him , neither Queen La Beale  Isoud ; for ever he deemed that Sir Palomides had smitten him so that he  should not be able to do battle with him at the day set .  CHAPTER LXXXVIII . How Sir Palomides kept his day to have foughten , but  Sir Tristram might not come ; and other things .  But in no wise there was no knight about Sir Tristram that would  believe that ever Sir Palomides would hurt Sir Tristram , neither by his  own hands nor by none other consenting . Then when the fifteenth day was  come , Sir Palomides came to the well with four knights with him of  Arthur ’s court , and three sergeants - of - arms . And for this intent Sir  Palomides brought the knights with him and the sergeants - of - arms , for  they should bear record of the battle betwixt Sir Tristram and Sir  Palomides . And the one sergeant brought in his helm , the other his  spear , the third his sword . So thus Palomides came into the field , and  there he abode nigh two hours ; and then he sent a squire unto Sir  Tristram , and desired him to come into the field to hold his promise .

"<fantasy> The  well - intentioned efforts of the followers of the Court , who engagingly  endeavoured to divert the Imperial mind by performing certain feats  which they remembered to have witnessed on previous occasions , but  which , until the necessity arose , they had never essayed , were entirely  without result of a beneficial order .
"	"Even the accomplished Provider ’s  one attainment -- that of striking together both the hands and the feet  thrice simultaneously , while leaping into the air , and at the same time  producing a sound not unlike that emitted by a large and vigorous bee  when held captive in the fold of a robe , an action which never failed  to throw the illustrious Emperor into a most uncontrollable state of  amusement when performed within the Imperial Palace -- now only drew  from him the unsympathetic , if not actually offensive , remark that the  attitude and the noise bore a marked resemblance to those produced by a  person when being bowstrung , adding , with unprepossessing significance ,  that of the two entertainments he had an unevadable conviction that the  bowstringing would be the more acceptable and gravity - removing .  “ When Sen beheld the size and the silk - hung magnificence of the camp  into which his guide led him , he was filled with astonishment , and at  the same time recognized that he had acted in an injudicious and hasty  manner by so readily accepting the offer of a tael ; whereas , if he had  been in possession of the true facts of the case , as they now appeared ,  he would certainly have endeavoured to obtain double that amount before  consenting . As he was hesitating within himself whether the matter might  not even yet be arranged in a more advantageous manner , he was suddenly  led forward into the most striking and ornamental of the tents , and  commanded to engage the attention of the one in whose presence he found  himself , without delay .  “ From the first moment when the inimitable creatures began , at Sen ’s  spoken word , to go through the ordinary details of their domestic  affairs , there was no sort of doubt as to the nature of the success with  which their well - trained exertions would be received . The dark shadows  instantly forsook the enraptured Emperor ’s select brow , and from time  to time he expressed himself in words of most unrestrained and intimate  encouragement . So exuberant became the overjoyed Provider ’s emotion at  having at length succeeded in obtaining the services of one who was  able to recall his Imperial master ’s unclouded countenance , that he came  forward in a most unpresentable state of haste , and rose into the air  uncommanded , for the display of his usually not unwelcome acquirement .  This he would doubtless have executed competently had not Sen , who stood  immediately behind him , suddenly and unexpectedly raised his voice in  a very vigorous and proficient duck cry , thereby causing the one before

"<fairy> The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling  wildly about , and the sea did what it liked , and what it liked was  destruction .
"	"It thundered at the town , and thundered at the cliffs , and  brought the coast down , madly . The air among the houses was of so strong  a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be  dipped in it , as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea . A little  fishing was done in the port , and a quantity of strolling about by  night , and looking seaward : particularly at those times when the tide  made , and was near flood . Small tradesmen , who did no business whatever ,  sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes , and it was remarkable  that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter .  As the day declined into the afternoon , and the air , which had been  at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen , became  again charged with mist and vapour , Mr. Lorry ’s thoughts seemed to cloud  too . When it was dark , and he sat before the coffee - room fire , awaiting  his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast , his mind was busily digging ,  digging , digging , in the live red coals .  A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no  harm , otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work .  Mr. Lorry had been idle a long time , and had just poured out his last  glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is  ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has  got to the end of a bottle , when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow  street , and rumbled into the inn - yard .  He set down his glass untouched . “ This is Mam’selle ! ” said he .  In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette  had arrived from London , and would be happy to see the gentleman from  Tellson ’s .  “ So soon ? ”  Miss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road , and required none  then , and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellson ’s  immediately , if it suited his pleasure and convenience .  The gentleman from Tellson ’s had nothing left for it but to empty his  glass with an air of stolid desperation , settle his odd little flaxen  wig at the ears , and follow the waiter to Miss Manette ’s apartment .  It was a large , dark room , furnished in a funereal manner with black  horsehair , and loaded with heavy dark tables . These had

"" If  you will breakfast in my house while I go to the neighbours you shall  have some horses , master . ""  So they entered the house , and the smith with many bows gave the  travellers over to the care of his wife , who saw from her husband 's  manner that these were persons of importance and as such she treated  them both , and as such entertained them to their second breakfast . And  this meant they ate heartily , as travellers can , who can go without a  breakfast or eat two ; and those who dwell in cities can do neither .  And while the plump dame did them honour they spoke no word of the  forest , for they knew not what place her husband 's early years had in  her imagination .  They had barely finished their meal when the sound of hooves on cobbles  was heard and Gonzalez beat on the door . They all went to the door and  found him there with two horses . The horses were saddled and bridled .  They fixed the stirrups to please them , then the travellers mounted at  once . Rodriguez made his grateful farewell to the wife of the smith :  then , turning to Gonzalez , he pointed to the two tired horses which had  waited all the while with their reins thrown over a hook on the wall .  "" Let the owner of these have them till his own come back , "" he said , and  added : "" How far may I take these ? ""  "" They are good horses , "" said the smith .  "" Yes , "" said Rodriguez .

"	"  There  he lay , with strange confusion of his scarlet , gold - wrought robes ;  silent , motionless , and dead .   The seven brethren stood together on a  marble terrace of the royal palace , that was dotted about on the baluster  of it with white statues : they were helmetted , and armed to the teeth ,  only over their armour great black cloaks were thrown .  Now the whole great terrace was a - sway with the crowd of nobles and  princes , and others that were neither nobles or princes , but true men  only ; and these were helmetted and wrapped in black cloaks even as the  princes were , only the crests of the princes ' helms were wrought  wonderfully with that bird , the phoenix , all flaming with new power ,  dying because its old body is not strong enough for its new - found power :  and those on that terrace who were unarmed had anxious faces , some  fearful , some stormy with Devil 's rage at disappointment ; but among the  faces of those helmed ones , though here and there you might see a pale  face , there was no fear or rage , scarcely even any anxiety , but calm ,  brave joy seemed to be on all .  Above the heads of all men on that terrace shone out Svend 's brave face ,  the golden hair flowing from out of his helmet : a smile of quiet  confidence overflowing from his mighty heart , in the depths of which it  was dwelling , just showed a very little on his eyes and lips .  While all the vast square , and all the windows and roofs even of the  houses over against the palace , were alive with an innumerable sea of  troubled raging faces , showing white , upturned from the under - sea of  their many - coloured raiment ; the murmur from them was like the sough of  the first tempest - wind among the pines , and the gleam of spears here and  there like the last few gleams of the sun through the woods when the  black thunder - clouds come up over all , soon to be shone through , those  woods , by the gleam of the deep lightning .  Also sometimes the murmur would swell , and from the heart of it would  come a fierce , hoarse , tearing , shattering roar , strangely discordant , of  ' War !   War ! give us war , O king ! '  Then Svend stepping forward , his arms hidden under his long cloak as they  hung down quietly , the smile on his face broadening somewhat , sent from

He told what  excellent butter and cheese Baucis made , and how nice were the  vegetables which he raised in his garden . He said , too , that , because  they loved one another so very much , it was the wish of both that  death might not separate them , but that they should die , as they had  lived , together .  As the stranger listened , a smile beamed over his countenance , and  made its expression as sweet as it was grand .  "" You are a good old man , "" said he to Philemon , "" and you have a good  old wife to be your helpmeet . It is fit that your wish be granted . ""  And it seemed to Philemon , just then , as if the sunset clouds threw up  a bright flash from the west , and kindled a sudden light in the sky .  Baucis had now got supper ready , and , coming to the door , began to  make apologies for the poor fare which she was forced to set before  her guests .

"<fairy>  Meantime , overseeing the other part of the ship , Captain Peleg ripped  and swore astern in the most frightful manner .
"	"I almost thought he  would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up ; involuntarily I  paused on my handspike , and told Queequeg to do the same , thinking of  the perils we both ran , in starting on the voyage with such a devil for  a pilot . I was comforting myself , however , with the thought that in  pious Bildad might be found some salvation , spite of his seven hundred  and seventy - seventh lay ; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear ,  and turning round , was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in  the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity . That was my  first kick .  “ Is that the way they heave in the marchant service ? ” he roared .  “ Spring , thou sheep - head ; spring , and break thy backbone ! Why do n’t ye  spring , I say , all of ye — spring ! Quohog ! spring , thou chap with the red  whiskers ; spring there , Scotch - cap ; spring , thou green pants . Spring , I  say , all of ye , and spring your eyes out ! ” And so saying , he moved  along the windlass , here and there using his leg very freely , while  imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody . Thinks I ,  Captain Peleg must have been drinking something to - day .  At last the anchor was up , the sails were set , and off we glided . It  was a short , cold Christmas ; and as the short northern day merged into  night , we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean , whose  freezing spray cased us in ice , as in polished armor . The long rows of  teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight ; and like the white  ivory tusks of some huge elephant , vast curving icicles depended from  the bows .  Lank Bildad , as pilot , headed the first watch , and ever and anon , as  the old craft deep dived into the green seas , and sent the shivering  frost all over her , and the winds howled , and the cordage rang , his  steady notes were heard , —  _ “ Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood , Stand dressed in living  green . So to the Jews old Canaan stood , While Jordan rolled between . ” _  Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then . They  were full of hope and fruition . Spite of this frigid winter night in  the boisterous Atlantic , spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket ,

"	"  "" I hope  that is my good fortune . ""  "" Her papa -- Captain Crewe -- is very anxious that she should begin the  language .   But I am afraid she has a childish prejudice against it . She  does not seem to wish to learn , "" said Miss Minchin .  "" I am sorry of that , mademoiselle , "" he said kindly to Sara .   "" Perhaps ,  when we begin to study together , I may show you that it is a charming  tongue . ""  Little Sara rose in her seat .   She was beginning to feel rather  desperate , as if she were almost in disgrace .   She looked up into  Monsieur Dufarge 's face with her big , green - gray eyes , and they were  quite innocently appealing .   She knew that he would understand as soon  as she spoke .   She began to explain quite simply in pretty and fluent  French .   Madame had not understood .   She had not learned French  exactly -- not out of books -- but her papa and other people had always  spoken it to her , and she had read it and written it as she had read  and written English . Her papa loved it , and she loved it because he  did .   Her dear mamma , who had died when she was born , had been French .  She would be glad to learn anything monsieur would teach her , but what  she had tried to explain to madame was that she already knew the words  in this book -- and she held out the little book of phrases .  When she began to speak Miss Minchin started quite violently and sat  staring at her over her eyeglasses , almost indignantly , until she had  finished .   Monsieur Dufarge began to smile , and his smile was one of  great pleasure .   To hear this pretty childish voice speaking his own  language so simply and charmingly made him feel almost as if he were in  his native land -- which in dark , foggy days in London sometimes seemed  worlds away .   When she had finished , he took the phrase book from her ,  with a look almost affectionate . But he spoke to Miss Minchin .  "" Ah , madame , "" he said , "" there is not much I can teach her .   She has not  LEARNED French ; she is French .   Her accent is exquisite . ""  "" You ought to have told me , "" exclaimed Miss Minchin , much mortified ,  turning to Sara .

She brought all the curtains  of the house for Mrs. Morris to do up , and in her pretty broken English  praised Johnny 's gallery and library , promising to bring Fay to see him  some day .  Meantime the little people prattled daily together , and all manner of  things came and went between them . Flowers , fruit , books , and bonbons  kept Johnny in a state of bliss , and inspired him with such brilliant  inventions that the Princess never knew what agreeable surprise would  come next . Astonishing kites flew over the wall , and tissue balloons  exploded in the flower - beds . All the birds of the air seemed to live in  that court ; for the boy whistled and piped till he was hoarse , because  she liked it . The last of the long - hoarded cents came out of his tin  bank to buy paper and pictures for the gay little books he made for her .  His side of the wall was ravaged that hers might be adorned ; and , as the  last offering his grateful heart could give , he poked the toad through  the hole , to live among the lilies and eat the flies that began to  buzz about her Highness when she came to give her orders to her devoted  subjects .  She always called the lad Giovanni , because she thought it a prettier  name than John ; and she was never tired of telling stories , asking  questions , and making plans . The favorite one was what they would do  when Johnny came to see her , as she had been promised he should when  papa was not too busy to let them enjoy the charms of the studio ;  for Fay was a true artist 's child , and thought nothing so lovely as  pictures . Johnny thought so , too , and dreamed of the happy day when he  should go and see the wonders his little friend described so well .  "" I think it will be to - morrow ; for papa has a lazy fit coming on , and  then he always plays with me and lets me rummage where I like , while he  goes out or smokes in the garden .

"	"As soon as he reached a yenoki tree , he  said to the dog , threateningly :  “ If there were gold coins under your master ’s tree , there must also be  gold coins under my tree . You must find them for me ! Where are they ?  Where ? Where ? ”  And catching hold of Shiro ’s neck he held the dog ’s head to the ground ,  so that Shiro began to scratch and dig in order to free himself from  the horrid old man ’s grasp .  The old man was very pleased when he saw the dog begin to scratch and  dig , for he at once supposed that some gold coins lay buried under his  tree as well as under his neighbor ’s , and that the dog had scented them  as before ; so pushing Shiro away he began to dig himself , but there was  nothing to be found . As he went on digging a foul smell was noticeable ,  and he at last came upon a refuse heap .  The old man ’s disgust can be imagined . This soon gave way to anger . He  had seen his neighbor ’s good fortune , and hoping for the same luck  himself , he had borrowed the dog Shiro ; and now , just as he seemed on  the point of finding what he sought , only a horrid smelling refuse heap  had rewarded him for a morning ’s digging . Instead of blaming his own  greed for his disappointment , he blamed the poor dog . He seized his  spade , and with all his strength struck Shiro and killed him on the  spot . He then threw the dog ’s body into the hole which he had dug in  the hope of finding a treasure of gold coins , and covered it over with  the earth . Then he returned to the house , telling no one , not even his  wife , what he had done .  After waiting several days , as the dog Shiro did not return , his master  began to grow anxious . Day after day went by and the good old man  waited in vain . Then he went to his neighbor and asked him to give him  back his dog . Without any shame or hesitation , the wicked neighbor  answered that he had killed Shiro because of his bad behavior . At this  dreadful news Shiro ’s master wept many sad and bitter tears . Great  indeed , was his woful surprise , but he was too good and gentle to  reproach his bad neighbor .

"<fairy> And likewise  call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh the  best musk .
"	"Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of  ill - savor , Cologne - water , in its rudimental manufacturing stages , is  the worst .  I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal , but  can not , owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against  whalemen , and which , in the estimation of some already biased minds ,  might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said  of the Frenchman ’s two whales . Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous  aspersion has been disproved , that the vocation of whaling is  throughout a slatternly , untidy business . But there is another thing to  rebut . They hint that all whales always smell bad . Now how did this  odious stigma originate ?  I opine , that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the  Greenland whaling ships in London , more than two centuries ago . Because  those whalemen did not then , and do not now , try out their oil at sea  as the Southern ships have always done ; but cutting up the fresh  blubber in small bits , thrust it through the bung holes of large casks ,  and carry it home in that manner ; the shortness of the season in those  Icy Seas , and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed ,  forbidding any other course . The consequence is , that upon breaking  into the hold , and unloading one of these whale cemeteries , in the  Greenland dock , a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising  from excavating an old city grave - yard , for the foundations of a  Lying - in Hospital .  I partly surmise also , that this wicked charge against whalers may be  likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland , in former  times , of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg , which  latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack , in his great  work on Smells , a text - book on that subject . As its name imports  ( smeer , fat ; berg , to put up ) , this village was founded in order to  afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried  out , without being taken home to Holland for that purpose . It was a  collection of furnaces , fat - kettles , and oil sheds ; and when the works  were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor . But  all this is quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler ; which in a  voyage of four years perhaps ,

"<fantasy>  He led the young man from the spot until they had come to a wide avenue  that led to the palace beyond .
"	"“ Here I leave thee , ” said the Demon , “ But  if ever thou hast need of me , call and I will come . ”  Thereupon he vanished like a flash , leaving the young man standing like  one in a dream .  He saw before him a garden of such splendor and magnificence as he had  never dreamed of even in his wildest fancy . There were seven fountains  as clear as crystal that shot high into the air and fell back into  basins of alabaster . There was a broad avenue as white as snow , and  thousands of lights lit up everything as light as day . Upon either side  of the avenue stood a row of black slaves , clad in garments of white  silk , and with jewelled turbans upon their heads . Each held a flaming  torch of sandal - wood . Behind the slaves stood a double row of armed men ,  and behind them a great crowd of other slaves and attendants , dressed  each as magnificently as a prince , blazing and flaming with innumerable  jewels and ornaments of gold .  But of all these things the young man thought nothing and saw nothing ;  for at the end of the marble avenue there arose a palace , the like of  which was not in the four quarters of the earth -- a palace of marble and  gold and carmine and ultramarine -- rising into the purple starry sky ,  and shining in the moonlight like a vision of Paradise . The palace was  illuminated from top to bottom and from end to end ; the windows shone  like crystal , and from it came sounds of music and rejoicing .  When the crowd that stood waiting saw the young man appear , they  shouted : “ Welcome ! Welcome ! To the master who has come again ! To Aben  Hassen the Fool ! ”  The young man walked up the avenue of marble to the palace , surrounded  by the armed attendants in their dresses of jewels and gold , and  preceded by dancing - girls as beautiful as houris , who danced and sung  before him . He was dizzy with joy . “ All -- all this , ” he exulted , “ belongs  to me . And to think that if I had listened to the Talisman of Solomon I  would have had none of it . ”  That was the way he came back to the treasure of the ancient kings of  Egypt , and to the palace of enchantment that his father had quitted .  For seven months he lived a life of joy and delight , surrounded by  crowds of courtiers as though they were a

"<fairy>  West Virginia was strongly for the Union in sentiment , and was set off  from the original State of Virginia , and , after some fighting the first  year of the war over its territory , came into line with the Northern  States .
"	"The fighting here was not severe . Generals McClellan and  Rosecrans ( Union ) and Lee ( Confederate ) were the principal commanders .  The first year of the war was largely spent in sparring for wind , as one  very able authority has it .  In the next chapter reference will be made to the battle of Bull Run ,  and the odium will be placed where it belongs . The author reluctantly  closes this chapter in order to go out and get some odium for that  purpose .  CHAPTER XXV .  BULL RUN AND OTHER BATTLES .  On the 21st of July , 1861 , occurred the battle of Bull Run , under the  joint management of General Irwin McDowell and General P. G. T.  Beauregard . After a sharp conflict , the Confederates were repulsed , but  rallied again under General T. J. Jackson , called thereafter Stonewall  Jackson . While the Federals were striving to beat Jackson back , troops  under Generals Early and Kirby Smith from Manassas Junction were hurled  against their flank.[5 ] McDowell 's men retreated , and as they reached  the bridge a shell burst among their crowded and chaotic numbers . A  caisson was upset , and a panic ensued , many of the troops continuing at  a swift canter till they reached the Capitol , where they could call on  the sergeant - at - arms to preserve order .  As a result of this run on the banks of the Potomac , the North suddenly  decided that the war might last a week or two longer than at first  stated , that the foe could not be killed with cornstalks , and that a  mistake had been made in judging that the rebellion was n't loaded.[6 ]  Half a million men were called for and five hundred million dollars  voted . General George B. McClellan took command of the Army of the  Potomac .  The battle of Ball 's Bluff resulted disastrously to the Union forces ,  and two thousand men were mostly driven into the Potomac , some drowned  and others shot . Colonel Baker , United States Senator from Oregon , was  killed .  The war in Missouri now opened . Captain Lyon reserved the United States  arsenal at St. Louis , and defeated Colonel Marmaduke at Booneville .  General Sigel was defeated at Carthage , July 5 , by the Confederates : so  Lyon , with five thousand men , decided to attack more than twice that  number of the enemy under Price and McCulloch , which he did , August 10 ,  at Wilson 's Creek . He was killed while making a charge , and his men were  defeated .  General Frémont then took command

At this time there were many growing up to be men in Midfirth ;  Skald - Torfa dwelt at Torfa's - stead in those days ; her son was called  Bessi , he was the shapeliest of men and a good skald .  At Meal lived two brothers , Kormak and Thorgils , with them a man  called Odd was fostered , and was called the Foundling - skald .  One called Audun was growing up at Audunstead in Willowdale , he was  a kind and good man to deal with , and the strongest in those north  parts , of all who were of an age with him . Kalf Asgeirson dwelt  at Asgeir's - river , and his brother Thorvald with him . Atli also ,  Grettir 's brother , was growing into a ripe man at that time ; the  gentlest of men he was , and well beloved of all . Now these men  settled to have ball - play together on Midfirth Water ; thither came the  Midfirthers , and Willowdale men , and men from Westhope , and Waterness ,  and Ramfirth , but those who came from far abode at the play - stead .  Now those who were most even in strength were paired together , and  thereat was always the greatest sport in autumn - tide . But when he was  fourteen years old Grettir went to the plays , because he was prayed  thereto by his brother Atli .  Now were all paired off for the plays , and Grettir was allotted to  play against Audun , the aforenamed , who was some winters the eldest of  the two ; Audun struck the ball over Grettir 's head , so that he could  not catch it , and it bounded far away along the ice ; Grettir got angry  thereat , deeming that Audun would outplay him ; but he fetches the ball  and brings it back , and , when he was within reach of Audun , hurls  it right against his forehead , and smites him so that the skin was  broken ; then Audun struck at Grettir with the bat he held in his hand ,  but smote him no hard blow , for Grettir ran in under the stroke ; and  thereat they seized one another with arms clasped , and wrestled . Then  all saw that Grettir was stronger than he had been taken to be , for  Audun was a man full of strength .  A long tug they had of it , but the end was that Grettir fell , and  Audun thrust his knees against his belly and breast , and

He had also provided suitable ornaments , fur  coverings for the hands and face , and a sword and shield . Waking  Hoang , he quickly dressed him , sprinkled a costly perfume about his  head and face , and taking him for the last time by the hand he led him  into the presence of the stranger .  “ Kwo Kam , chosen representative of the sacred line of Tang , ” began the  Being , when he and Hoang had exchanged signs and greetings of equality  in an obscure tongue , “ the grafted peach - tree on the Crystal Wall is  stricken and the fruit is ripe and rotten to the touch . The flies that  have fed upon its juice are drunk with it and lie helpless on the  ground ; the skin is empty and blown out with air , the leaves withered ,  and about the root is coiled a great worm which has secretly worked to  this end . From the Five Points of the kingdom and beyond the Outer  Willow Circle the Sheaf - binders have made a full report and it has  been judged that the time is come for the tree to be roughly shaken .  To this destiny the Old Ones of your race now call you ; but beware of  setting out unless your face should be unchangingly fixed and your  heart pure from all earthly desires and base considerations . ”  “ The decision is too ever - present in my mind to need reflection , ”   replied Hoang resolutely . “ To grind to powder that presumptuous tyrant  utterly , to restore the integrity of the violated boundaries of the  land , and to set up again the venerable Tablets of the true Tang  line -- these desires have long since worn away the softer portion of  this person ’s heart by constant thought . ”  “ The choice has been made and the words have been duly set down , ” said  the Being . “ If you maintain your high purpose to a prosperous end  nothing can exceed your honour in the Upper Air ; if you fail culpably ,  or even through incapacity , the lot of Fuh - chi himself will be  enviable compared with yours . ”  Understanding that the time had now come for his departure , Hoang  approached Ten - teh as though he would have embraced him , but the Being  made a gesture of restraint .  “

"	"  So I  said : "" And south of the river , what is it like ? ""  He said : "" You would find it much the same as the land about Hammersmith .  North , again , the land runs up high , and there is an agreeable and well-  built town called Hampstead , which fitly ends London on that side .   It  looks down on the north - western end of the forest you passed through . ""  I smiled .   "" So much for what was once London , "" said I.   "" Now tell me  about the other towns of the country . ""  He said : "" As to the big murky places which were once , as we know , the  centres of manufacture , they have , like the brick and mortar desert of  London , disappeared ; only , since they were centres of nothing but  ' manufacture , ' and served no purpose but that of the gambling market ,  they have left less signs of their existence than London .   Of course , the  great change in the use of mechanical force made this an easy matter , and  some approach to their break - up as centres would probably have taken  place , even if we had not changed our habits so much : but they being such  as they were , no sacrifice would have seemed too great a price to pay for  getting rid of the ' manufacturing districts , ' as they used to be called .  For the rest , whatever coal or mineral we need is brought to grass and  sent whither it is needed with as little as possible of dirt , confusion ,  and the distressing of quiet people 's lives .   One is tempted to believe  from what one has read of the condition of those districts in the  nineteenth century , that those who had them under their power worried ,  befouled , and degraded men out of malice prepense : but it was not so ;  like the mis - education of which we were talking just now , it came of  their dreadful poverty .

"	"To lose all , as would  most assuredly happen if he had to leave his arranged rooms and secret  preparations and take to flight , was the more bitter because he felt  surer than ever that success was even standing by his side . The very  subtle liquid , which would mix itself into the component parts of the  living creature which drank it , and by an insidious and harmless process  so work that , when the spirit departed , the flesh would become resolved  into a figure of pure and solid gold of the finest quality , had engaged  the refined minds of many of the most expert individuals of remote  ages . With most of these inspired persons , however , the search had  been undertaken in pure - minded benevolence , their chief aim being an  honourable desire to discover a method by which one ’s ancestors might  be permanently and effectively preserved in a fit and becoming manner to  receive the worship and veneration of posterity . Yet , in spite of these  amiable motives , and of the fact that the magician merely desired the  possession of the secret to enable him to become excessively wealthy ,  the affair had been so arranged that it should come into his possession .  The matter which concerned Mian in the dark wood , when she was only  saved by the appearance of the person who is already known as Ling ,  entirely removed all pleasurable emotions from the magician ’s mind , and  on many occasions he stated in a definite and systematic manner that he  would shortly end an ignoble career which seemed to be destined only  to gloom and disappointment . In this way an important misunderstanding  arose , for when , two days later , during the sound of matchlock  firing , the magician suddenly approached the presence of Mian with an  uncontrollable haste and an entire absence of dignified demeanour ,  and fell dead at her feet without expressing himself on any subject  whatever , she deliberately judged that in this manner he had carried his  remark into effect , nor did the closed vessel of yellow liquid which he  held in his hand seem to lead away from this decision . In reality , the  magician had fallen owing to the heavy and conflicting emotions which  success had engendered in an intellect already greatly weakened by  his continual disregard of the higher virtues ; for the bottle , indeed ,  contained the perfection of his entire life ’s study , the very expensive  and three - times purified gold liquid .  On perceiving the magician ’s condition , Mian at once called for the two  attendants , and directed them to bring from an inner

"<fantasy> It  was perfectly formed and glistened with a dozen or more superb tintings  that were so vivid and brilliant and blended into one another so  exquisitely that everyone paused to gaze enraptured upon the sight .
"	" Steadily , yet with wonderful swiftness , the end of the great bow  descended until it rested upon the pink field -- almost at the feet of  the little party of observers . Then they saw , dancing gaily upon the  arch , a score of beautiful maidens , dressed in fleecy robes of rainbow  tints which fluttered around them like clouds .  "" The Daughters of the Rainbow ! "" whispered Tourmaline in an awed voice ,  and the Witch beside her nodded and said , "" Fairies of the sky . What did  I tell you , Tourmaline ? ""  Just then one of the maidens tripped lightly down the span of the arch  until near the very end , leaning over to observe the group below . She  was exquisitely fair , dainty as a lily and graceful as a bough swaying  in the breeze . "" Why , it 's Polychrome ! "" exclaimed Button - Bright in a  voice of mingled wonder and delight . "" Hello , Polly ! Do n't you remember  me ? ""  "" Of course I remember Button - Bright , "" replied the maiden in a sweet ,  tinkling voice . "" The last time I saw you was in the Land of Oz . ""  "" Oh ! "" cried Trot , turning to stare at the boy with big , wide - open eyes .  "" Were you ever in the Land of Oz ? ""  "" Yes , "" he answered , still looking at the Rainbow 's Daughter , and then  he said appealingly , "" These people want to kill us , Polly . Ca n't you  help us ? ""    "" Polly wants a cracker !    Polly wants a cracker ! ""  screeched the parrot .  Polychrome straightened up and glanced at her sisters . "" Tell Father to  call for me in an hour or two , "" said she . "" There is work for me to do  here , for one of my old friends is in trouble . ""  With this she sprang lightly from the rainbow and stood beside  Button - Bright and Trot , and scarcely had she left the splendid arch  when it lifted and rose into the sky . The other end had been hidden in  the clouds , and now the Rainbow began to fade gradually , like mist , and  the sun broke through the clouds and shot its cheering rays over the  Pink Country until presently the Rainbow had vanished altogether and  the only reminder of it was the lovely Polychrome standing among the  wondering band of Pinkies . "" Tell me , "" she said gently to the boy , "" why  are you here

"	"       “ Blue as the sky , gentlemen .... ”        AFTERMATH        What Amory did that year from early September to late in the        spring was so purposeless and inconsecutive that it seems        scarcely worth recording . He was , of course , immediately sorry        for what he had lost . His philosophy of success had tumbled down        upon him , and he looked for the reasons .        “ Your own laziness , ” said Alec later .        “ No — something deeper than that . I ’ve begun to feel that I was        meant to lose this chance . ”        “ They ’re rather off you at the club , you know ; every man that        does n’t come through makes our crowd just so much weaker . ”        “ I hate that point of view . ”        “ Of course , with a little effort you could still stage a        comeback . ”        “ No — I’m through — as far as ever being a power in college is        concerned . ”        “ But , Amory , honestly , what makes me the angriest is n’t the fact        that you wo n’t be chairman of the Prince and on the Senior        Council , but just that you did n’t get down and pass that exam . ”        “ Not me , ” said Amory slowly ; “ I ’m mad at the concrete thing . My        own idleness was quite in accord with my system , but the luck        broke . ”        “ Your system broke , you mean . ”        “ Maybe . ”        “ Well , what are you going to do ? Get a better one quick , or just        bum around for two more years as a has - been ? ”        “ I do n’t know yet ... ”        “ Oh , Amory , buck up ! ”        “ Maybe . ”        Amory ’s point of view , though dangerous , was not far from the        true one . If his reactions to his environment could be tabulated ,        the chart would have appeared like this , beginning with his        earliest years :   1 . The fundamental Amory .   2 . Amory plus Beatrice .   3 . Amory plus Beatrice plus Minneapolis .        Then St. Regis ’ had pulled him to pieces and started him over        again :   4 . Amory plus St. Regis ’ .   5 . Amory plus St. Regis ’ plus Princeton .        That had been his nearest approach to success through conformity .        The fundamental Amory , idle , imaginative , rebellious , had been        nearly snowed under . He had conformed , he had succeeded , but as        his imagination was neither satisfied nor grasped

"<fairy> ”  “ You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by  the surgeon at the inquest .
"	"The blow was struck from immediately  behind , and yet was upon the left side . Now , how can that be unless it  were by a left - handed man ? He had stood behind that tree during the  interview between the father and son . He had even smoked there . I found  the ash of a cigar , which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables  me to pronounce as an Indian cigar . I have , as you know , devoted some  attention to this , and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140  different varieties of pipe , cigar , and cigarette tobacco . Having found  the ash , I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss  where he had tossed it . It was an Indian cigar , of the variety which  are rolled in Rotterdam . ”  “ And the cigar - holder ? ”  “ I could see that the end had not been in his mouth . Therefore he used  a holder . The tip had been cut off , not bitten off , but the cut was not  a clean one , so I deduced a blunt pen - knife . ”  “ Holmes , ” I said , “ you have drawn a net round this man from which he  can not escape , and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if  you had cut the cord which was hanging him . I see the direction in  which all this points . The culprit is — ”  “ Mr. John Turner , ” cried the hotel waiter , opening the door of our  sitting - room , and ushering in a visitor .  The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure . His slow ,  limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude ,  and yet his hard , deep - lined , craggy features , and his enormous limbs  showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of  character . His tangled beard , grizzled hair , and outstanding , drooping  eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his  appearance , but his face was of an ashen white , while his lips and the  corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue . It was clear  to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic  disease .  “ Pray sit down on the sofa , ” said Holmes gently . “ You had my note ? ”  “ Yes , the lodge - keeper brought it up . You said that you wished to see  me here to avoid scandal . ”  “

"<fantasy> I walked the whole length of the shop , still no one politely  followed .
"	" Seeing from this that some extraordinary revolution had occurred in  the jewelry business I went with my curiosity well aroused to a queer  old person half demon and half man who has an idol - shop in a byway of  the City and who keeps me informed of affairs at the Edge of the  World . And briefly over a pinch of heather incense that he takes by  way of snuff he gave me this tremendous information : that Mr. Neepy  Thang the son of Thangobrind had returned from the Edge of the World  and was even now in London .  The information may not appear tremendous to those unacquainted with  the source of jewelry ; but when I say that the only thief employed by  any West - end jeweller since famous Thangobrind 's distressing doom is  this same Neepy Thang , and that for lightness of fingers and swiftness  of stockinged foot they have none better in Paris , it will be  understood why the Bond Street jewellers no longer cared what became  of their old stock .  There were big diamonds in London that summer and a few considerable  sapphires . In certain astounding kingdoms behind the East strange  sovereigns missed from their turbans the heirlooms of ancient wars ,  and here and there the keepers of crown jewels who had not heard the  stockinged feet of Thang , were questioned and died slowly .  And the jewellers gave a little dinner to Thang at the Hotel Great  Magnificent ; the windows had not been opened for five years and there  was wine at a guinea a bottle that you could not tell from champagne  and cigars at half a crown with a Havana label . Altogether it was a  splendid evening for Thang .  But I have to tell of a far sadder thing than a dinner at a hotel . The  public require jewelry and jewelry must be obtained . I have to tell of  Neepy Thang 's last journey .  That year the fashion was emeralds . A man named Green had recently  crossed the Channel on a bicycle and the jewellers said that a green  stone would be particularly appropriate to commemorate the event and  recommended emeralds .  Now a certain money - lender of Cheapside who had just been made a peer  had divided his gains into three equal parts ; one for the purchase of  the peerage , country house and park , and the twenty thousand pheasants  that are absolutely essential , and one for the upkeep of the position ,  while the third he banked abroad , partly to cheat the native  tax - gatherer and partly because it seemed to him that the days of the  Peerage were few

"<fairy> When darkness came on , he saw a light ,  which he went up to , and came to a house wherein lived a witch .
"	"“ Do  give me one night ’s lodging , and a little to eat and drink , ” said he to  her , “ or I shall starve . ” “ Oho ! ” she answered , “ who gives anything to a  run - away soldier ? Yet will I be compassionate , and take you in , if you  will do what I wish . ” “ What do you wish ? ” said the soldier . “ That you  should dig all round my garden for me , tomorrow . ” The soldier  consented , and next day labored with all his strength , but could not  finish it by the evening . “ I see well enough , ” said the witch , “ that  you can do no more to - day , but I will keep you yet another night , in  payment for which you must to - morrow chop me a load of wood , and make  it small . ” The soldier spent the whole day in doing it , and in the  evening the witch proposed that he should stay one night more .  “ To - morrow , you shall only do me a very trifling piece of work . Behind  my house , there is an old dry well , into which my light has fallen , it  burns blue , and never goes out , and you shall bring it up again for  me . ” Next day the old woman took him to the well , and let him down in a  basket . He found the blue light , and made her a signal to draw him up  again . She did draw him up , but when he came near the edge , she  stretched down her hand and wanted to take the blue light away from  him . “ No , ” said he , perceiving her evil intention , “ I will not give  thee the light until I am standing with both feet upon the ground . ” The  witch fell into a passion , let him down again into the well , and went  away .  The poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground , and the blue  light went on burning , but of what use was that to him ? He saw very  well that he could not escape death . He sat for a while very  sorrowfully , then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco  pipe , which was still half full . “ This shall be my last pleasure , ”  thought he , pulled it out , lit it at the blue light and began to smoke .  When the smoke had circled about the cavern , suddenly a little

"<fairy> Now the  maiden still lay sleeping , and she was quite sewn into her night - dress ,  and he cut a morsel from this also , and thrust it in with the rest , but  he did all without touching her .
"	"Then he went forth and left her lying  asleep undisturbed , and when he came to the gate again , the giants were  still standing outside waiting for him , and expecting that he was  bringing the princess . But he cried to them that they were to come in ,  for the maiden was already in their power , that he could not open the  gate to them , but there was a hole through which they must creep . Then  the first approached , and the huntsman wound the giant ’s hair round his  hand , pulled the head in , and cut it off at one stroke with his sword ,  and then drew the rest of him in . He called to the second and cut his  head off likewise , and then he killed the third also , and he was well  pleased that he had freed the beautiful maiden from her enemies , and he  cut out their tongues and put them in his knapsack . Then thought he , “ I  will go home to my father and let him see what I have already done , and  afterwards I will travel about the world ; the luck which God is pleased  to grant me will easily find me . ”  But when the King in the castle awoke , he saw the three giants lying  there dead . So he went into the sleeping - room of his daughter , awoke  her , and asked who could have killed the giants ? Then said she , “ Dear  father , I know not , I have been asleep . ” But when she arose and would  have put on her slippers , the right one was gone , and when she looked  at her neck - kerchief it was cut , and the right corner was missing , and  when she looked at her night - dress a piece was cut out of it . The King  summoned his whole court together , soldiers and every one else who was  there , and asked who had set his daughter at liberty , and killed the  giants ? Now it happened that he had a captain , who was one - eyed and a  hideous man , and he said that he had done it . Then the old King said  that as he had accomplished this , he should marry his daughter . But the  maiden said , “ Rather than marry him , dear father , I will go away into  the world as far as my legs can carry me . ” But the King said that if  she would not marry him she should take off her royal garments and wear  peasant ’s clothing , and go forth ,

Show me then this  body . ”   “ Oh wife , him to whom this ring belonged thou shalt see here in  the evening . ”   “ And who is he ? ” asked the woman , “ Kilhwch the son of  Kilydd , the son of Prince Kelyddon , by Goleuddydd the daughter of Prince  Anlawdd , his mother , who is come to seek Olwen as his wife . ”   And when  she heard that , her feelings were divided between the joy that she had  that her nephew , the son of her sister , was coming to her , and sorrow  because she had never known any one depart alive who had come on that  quest .  And they went forward to the gate of Custennin the herdsman ’s dwelling .  And when she heard their footsteps approaching , she ran out with joy to  meet them .   And Kai snatched a billet out of the pile .   And when she met  them she sought to throw her arms about their necks .   And Kai placed the  log between her two hands , and she squeezed it so that it became a  twisted coil .   “ Oh woman , ” said Kai , “ if thou hadst squeezed me thus ,  none could ever again have set their affections on me .   Evil love were  this . ”   They entered into the house , and were served ; and soon after they  all went forth to amuse themselves .   Then the woman opened a stone chest  that was before the chimney - corner , and out of it arose a youth with  yellow curling hair .   Said Gwrhyr , “ It is a pity to hide this youth .   I  know that it is not his own crime that is thus visited upon him . ”   “ This  is but a remnant , ” said the woman .   “ Three - and - twenty of my sons has  Yspaddaden Penkawr slain , and I have no more hope of this one than of the  others . ”   Then said Kai , “ Let him come and be a companion with me , and he  shall not be slain unless I also am slain with him . ”   And they ate .

"	"Exactly when and exactly how Fate , that king of  gold - brick men , had cheated him he could not say ; but he knew , with a  certainty that defied argument , that there had been sharp practise , and  that in an unguarded moment he had been induced to part with something  of infinite value in exchange for a gilded fraud .  The mystery baffled him . He sent his mind back to the first definite  entry of Mervo into the foreground of his life . He had come up from his  stateroom on to the deck of the little steamer , and there in the  pearl - gray of the morning was the island , gradually taking definite  shape as the pink mists shredded away before the rays of the rising  sun . As the ship rounded the point where the lighthouse still flashed a  needless warning from its cluster of jagged rocks , he had had his first  view of the town , nestling at the foot of the hill , gleaming white  against the green , with the gold - domed Casino towering in its midst . In  all Southern Europe there was no view to match it for quiet beauty . For  all his thews and sinews there was poetry in John , and the sight had  stirred him like wine .  It was not then that depression had begun , nor was it during the  reception at the quay .  The days that had followed had been peaceful and amusing . He could not  detect in any one of them a sign of the approaching shadow . They had  been lazy days . His duties had been much more simple than he had  anticipated . He had not known , before he tried it , that it was possible  to be a prince with so small an expenditure of mental energy . As Mr.  Scobell had hinted , to all intents and purposes he was a mere ornament .  His work began at eleven in the morning , and finished as a rule at  about a quarter after . At the hour named a report of the happenings of  the previous day was brought to him . When he had read it the state  asked no more of him until the next morning .  The report was made up of such items as "" A fisherman named Lesieur  called Carbineer Ferrier a fool in the market - place at eleven minutes  after two this afternoon ; he has not been arrested , but is being  watched , "" and generally gave John a few minutes of mild enjoyment .  Certainly he could not recollect that it had ever depressed him .  No , it had been something else
