In _ The London Chronicle _ for December 19 - -January 1 , 1765 - -the   following advertisement appeared:--    " The Philosophers , Politicians , Necromancers , and the Learned in every     Faculty are desired to observe that on the 1st of January , being New     Year 's Day ( Oh , that we may all lead new Lives ! ) , Mr Newbery intends     to publish the following important volumes , bound and gilt , and hereby     invites all his little friends who are good to call for them at the     Bible and Sun , in St Paul 's Churchyard : but those who are naughty are     to have none . 
" [ A ]   Many of these little books have been doubtless long since forgotten ,   though they did not deserve such a fate ; but the name of " Goody Two   Shoes " is still familiar to the ears of English children , though the   book itself may be unknown to thousands of little ones of this later   generation . 
  It was at one time commonly attributed to Oliver Goldsmith , and no one   who reads the book will consider it to be unworthy of the poet 's pen . 
I give abbreviated titles only , but if space permitted I mould   like to quote them in full ; they are remarkable no less for their   curious quaintness and their clever ingenuity than for their   attractiveness to both parents ( who , it must not be forgotten , are   more often the real buyers of children 's books ) and the young people   for whom they were written , and they are in themselves most   entertaining and amusing reading . 
  The most striking of these parallels is perhaps that furnished by the   curious little political preface to the work -- a preface which is quite   unnecessary to the book , and I think would only have been inserted by   one who was full of the unjustnesses at which he was preparing to aim   a still heavier blow . 
' [ D ] We find in " Goody Two Shoes " every one of those   distinctive qualities of Goldsmith 's writings which Mr William Black   so well summarizes in the book already referred to--"his genuine and   tender pathos , that never at any time verges on the affected or   theatrical ; " his " quaint , delicate , delightful humour ; " his " broader   humour , that is not afraid to provoke the wholesome laughter of   mankind by dealing with common and familiar ways and manners and men ; "   his " choiceness of diction ; " his " lightness and grace of touch , that   lend a charm even to " his " ordinary hack work . 
The Gentleman ordered Little _ Margery _ a   new Pair of Shoes , gave Mr. _ Smith _ some Money to buy her   Cloathes ; and said , he would take _ Tommy _ and make him a little   Sailor ; and accordingly had a Jacket and Trowsers made for him , in   which he now appears . 
This so distressed Mr. _ Smith _   that he shed Tears , and cried , _ Lord have Mercy on the Poor ! _   The Prayers of the Righteous fly upwards , and reach unto the Throne of   Heaven , as will be seen in the Sequel . 
This was at their   Play ; and every Morning she used to go round to teach the Children   with these Rattle - traps in a Basket , as you see in the Print . 
  _ Bow wow , wow _ , says the Dog at the Door . 
  She then set them another Task , and we proceeded . 
  _ Polly _ still pouted ; upon which Little _ Margery _ said ,   though she was poor , and obliged to lie in a Barn , she would not keep   Company with such a naughty , proud , perverse Girl as _ Polly _ ; and   was going away ; however the Difference was made up , and she set them   to compose the following     LESSONS     For the CONDUCT of LIFE . 
  As we were returning Home , we saw a Gentleman , who was very ill ,   sitting under a shady Tree at the Corner of his Rookery . 
I go , Sir , says _ William _ , why the Ghost would frighten me   out of my Wits.--Mrs . 
It was dismal dark , and I could   see nothing ; but while I was standing in the Pew , something jumped up   upon me behind , and laid , as I thought , its Hands over my   Shoulders.--I own , I was a little afraid at first ; however , I   considered that I had always been constant at Prayers and at Church ,   and that I had done nobody any Harm , but had endeavoured to do what   Good I could ; and then , thought I , what have I to fear ? yet I kneeled   down to say my Prayers . 
  All the Company acknowledged the Justness of the Observation , and   thanked Little _ Two - Shoes _ for her Advice . 
As soon as he was informed who she   was , he took no Notice of her ; upon which she desired to speak to Lady   _ Gripe _ ; and having informed her Ladyship of the Affair , she went her   Way . 
    I.     The Lord my Pasture shall prepare ,     And feed me with a Shepherd 's Care :     His Presence shall my Wants supply ,     And guard me with a watchful Eye ;     My Noon - day Walks he shall attend ,     And all my Midnight Hours defend . 
I.                 _ Of her School , her Ushers , or Assistants ,                       and her Manner of Teaching . 
She called   his Name _ Ralph _ , and a fine Bird he is . 
  Some Time after this a poor Lamb had lost its Dam , and the Farmer   being about to kill it , she bought it of him , and brought it home with   her to play with the Children , and teach them when to go to Bed ; for   it was a Rule with the wise Men of that Age ( and a very good one , let   me tell you ) to     _ Rise with the Lark , and lie down with the Lamb . 
It is generally said , that we never know the real Value of our   Parents or Friends till we have lost them ; but poor _ Sally _ felt   this by Affection , and her Mistress knew it by Experience . 
Half the great Men in   _ London _ , I am told , have made themselves by this Means , and who   would but be honest and industrious , when it is so much our Interest   and our Duty . 
But the   perpetual Anxiety he was in , together with the Loss of his Appetite   and Want of Rest , soon alarmed his Wife . 
However , she   came down sooner than was expected , and with Tears embraced them again   and again : After which she told the Father and Mother she had heard from   their Daughter , who was her Acquaintance , and that she was well and on   her Return to England . 
  You see , my dear _ Sally _ , how wonderfully these People were   preserved , and made happy after such extreme Distress ; we are   therefore never to despair , even under the greatest Misfortunes , for   GOD Almighty is All - powerful and can deliver us at any Time . 
No sooner had he led her into the Garden , but he   ran back , and pulled out one of the Children in the same manner ; upon   which she ordered them all to leave the School immediately , and they   had not been out five Minutes , before the Top of the House fell in . 
Some of the Senses of   other Animals are more acute than ours , as we find by daily   Experience . 
God will bless you , but not   unless you are merciful and good . 
Every Body   knows , that _ Martha Wilson _ was a passionate scolding Jade , and   that _ John _ her husband , was a surly ill - tempered Fellow . 
Mrs. _ Margery _ , who had   the Art of moralizing and drawing Instructions from every Accident ,   took this Opportunity of reading them a Lecture on the Uncertainty of   Life , and the Necessity of being always prepared for Death . 
As this Cap was an universal Cure for   Wrong - headedness , and prevented numberless Disputes and Quarrels , it   greatly hurt the Trade of the poor Lawyers , but was of the utmost   Service to the rest of the Community . 
Remember what was said by my Brazen Head , _ Time   is , Time was , Time is past _ : Now the _ Time is _ , therefore buy   the Cap immediately , and make a proper Use of it , and be happy before   the _ Time is past _ . 
If I am a Witch , this is my   Charm , and ( laying a Barometer or Weather Glass on the Table ) it is   with this , says she , that I have taught my Neighbours to know the   State of the Weather . 
  ' Twas a Saying of Mr. _ Williams _ , who would sometimes be jocose ,   and had the Art of making even Satire agreeable ; that if ever   _ Jane _ deserved the Character of a Witch , it was after this Money   was left her ; for that with her five thousand Pounds , she did more   Acts of Charity and friendly Offices , than all the People of Fortune   within fifty Miles of the Place . 
They soon returned to   the Communion - Table , and were married in Tears , but they were Tears of   Joy . 
  This was a great Mortification to Sir _ Timothy _ , as well as to   his Friend _ Graspall _ , who from this Time experienced nothing but   Misfortunes , and was in a few Years so dispossessed of his Ill - gotten   Wealth , that his Family were reduced to seek Subsistance from the   Parish , at which those who had felt the Weight of his Iron Hand   rejoiced ; but Lady _ Margery _ desired , that his Children might be   treated with Care and Tenderness ; _ for they _ , says she , _ are no   Ways accountable for the Actions of their Father _ . 
_            To shew the Depravity of human Nature , and how apt the Mind is to be   misled by Trinkets and false Appearances , Mrs. _ Two - Shoes _ does   acknowledge , that after she became rich , she had like to have been too   fond of Money ; for on seeing her Husband receive a very large Sum , her   Heart went pit pat , pit pat , all the Evening , and she began to think   that Guineas were pretty Things . 
This   is a Precept from the Almighty , a Precept which must be regarded ; for   _ The Lord is about your Paths , and about your Bed , and spieth out   all your Ways _ . 
To this he added , that all the People for many Leagues   round came there every _ May _ Morning , expecting to see the   Stone - head turned to Gold . 
As _ Tom _ had Reason to venerate his Memory ,   he was very particular in his Enquiry , and had this Character of   him;--that he was a Man well acquainted with Nature and with Trade ;   that he was pious , friendly , and of a sweet and affable Disposition . 
They went together ,   opened the Ground , and found the Money they had first placed there ,   for the artful Wretch , he so much confided in , had conveyed it again   into the Pot , in order to obtain more . 
_ NINETEEN TWENTY - TWO _   PAUL Bunyan is the hero of lumbercamp whoppers that have been handed   down for generations . 
Paul had followed the White Pine from the   Atlantic seaboard west to the jumping - off place in Minnesota , why not go   the rest of the way ?   Paul Bunyan 's picture had never been published until he joined Red River   and this likeness , first issued in 1914 , is now the Red River trademark . 
Writing in the _ Pacific   Review _ , Mrs. Shepherd relates this one about Paul 's babyhood . 
He   serves a valuable purpose in giving every hardship and tough problem its   whimsical turn . 
"   " It is distinctly American " she writes , " No other country could possibly   produce a literary type just like it ; for it is , at least so I think , a   symbolic expression of the forces of physical labor at work in the   development of a great country . 
  Once in a while Babe would run away and be gone all day roaming all over   the Northwestern country . 
One oldtimer claims that the outfit he works for bought a hind   quarter of the carcass in 1857 and made corned beef of it . 
One cook got lost between the flour bin and the root   cellar and nearly starved to death before he was found . 
The first time Joe blew   it he blew down ten acres of pine . 
He filled up a big kettle with beans   and added some water . 
It is light , soft , even - textured , easy - to - work , durable and   will not warp or check . 
At the start his outfit   consisted of Babe and his big axe . 
They said he might make a pretty good man if he ever got   any growth , and considered it a necessary education to give him a lot of   extra chores . 
  After the Seven Axemen had gone down the tote road , never to return ,   Paul Bunyan was at a loss to find a method of cutting down trees that   would give him anything like the output he had been getting . 
It rained so   hard and so long that the grass was all washed out by the roots and Paul   had a great time feeding his cattle . 
At first she had some trouble with the   new foot gear but once she learned to run them and shift gears without   wrecking herself , she answered the call of the limitless snow fields and   ran away all over North America until Paul decorated her with a bell   borrowed from a buried church . 
  Paul Bunyan had his setbacks the same as every logger only his were   worse . 
Ole once carried a pair of these shoes a mile and   sunk knee deep into solid rock at every step . 
  Snowshoes were useful in winter but one trip on the webs cured Paul of   depending upon them for transcontinental hikes . 
The present   mosquito is but a degenerate remnant of the species . 
  Bill saved himself from drowning by climbing Babe 's tail but all efforts   to patch up the tank were in vain so the old tank was abandoned and   replaced by one of the new ones . 
This proved to be an advantage for the dog learned   to run on one pair of legs for a while and then flop over without loss   of speed and run on the other pair . 
At the landing the trees were cut off just like   shearing a sheep and the denuded section hauled back to it 's original   place . 
When he threw the old paddle into high he sure rambled and the   sea was covered with dead fish that broke their backs trying to watch   him coming and going . 
  The little girl came into her papa 's study , as she always did Saturday   morning before breakfast , and asked for a story . 
    The little girl was a good deal excited already , preparing for the     old - fashioned , once - a - year Christmas that was coming the next day , and     perhaps the Fairy 's promise did n't make such an impression on her as     it would have made at some other time . 
"   " Very well , then , I 'll take it all out . 
    The little girl began to get frightened , keeping the secret all to     herself ; she wanted to tell her mother , but she did n't dare to ; and     she was ashamed to ask the Fairy to take back her gift , it seemed     ungrateful and ill - bred , and she thought she would try to stand it ,     but she hardly knew how she could , for a whole year . 
    By that time people did n't carry presents around nicely any more . 
There are about twenty     million boys in the United States , and so you can imagine what a noise     they made . 
"   The little girl held her papa fast around the neck . 
  " Well , you see , " the papa began , on Christmas morning , when the little   girl had snuggled in his lap into just the right shape for listening ,   " it was the night after Thanksgiving , and you know how everybody feels   the night after Thanksgiving . 
"   " Oh yes ! "     Well , but the greatest thing of all was the turkey that they had . 
  " Did n't I say it was going to be a _ true _ story ? "   " Yes . 
At last one     of the boys -- it was the other little girl 's brother -- said he would     run across and get his papa to come out and help them , and the first     thing she knew the turkey was after him , gaining , gaining , gaining ,     and all the grass was full of hen - turkeys and turkey chicks , running     after him , and gaining , gaining , gaining , and just as he was getting     to the wall he tripped and fell over a turkey - pen , and all at once she     was in one of the aunties ' room , and the aunty was in bed , and the     turkeys were walking up and down over her , and stretching out their     wings , and blaming her . 
"     The other little girl was awfully frightened to have the hen - turkey     take that tack . 
  " I do n't believe I ever did , " said the little girl . 
"   " No , she did n't , " said the papa ; " and it was n't a dream . 
" Now , then , " she said , while the   papa let his head wag , after the shaking , like a Chinese mandarin 's , and   it was a good thing he did not let his tongue stick out . 
  " Well , it 's got a moral , " said the papa . 
" Well , I declare , papa , she was   putting up her lip . 
Still she had to say _ something _ , and perhaps the   little Pony Engine was better employed watching its buffers with its   head - light , to see whether its cow - catcher had begun to grow , than it   would have been in listening to the stories of the old locomotives , and   sometimes their swearing . 
  " Well , he was so excited for a while that he could n't tell whether the   Express was gaining on him or not ; but after twenty or thirty miles , he   thought he heard it pretty near . 
"   " Well , " the papa went on , " after that it had a little rest , for the   Express had to wait for the freight train to get off the bridge , and the   Pony Engine stopped at the first station for a drink of water and a   mouthful of coal , and then it flew ahead . 
By this time it could n't say ' Pacific Express ' any   more , and it did n't try . 
They all knew it as well as he knew   it himself , and they could keep him from making mistakes , or forgetting . 
But one night the cow got in , and the farmer was so mad ,   having to get up about one o'clock in the morning to drive the cow out ,   that he pulled up the stick , without noticing , to whack her over the   back with it , and so they lost the place . 
" And supposing it was ? Which is better :   to stay quietly at home , and do your duty , and grow up , and be eaten in   a pie at Thanksgiving , or go gadding all over the garden , and climbing   fences , and everything ? The good little pumpkin vine was perfectly   right , and the bad little pumpkin would have been saved a good deal if   it had minded its little sister . 
When it got to the fence at last , it thought it was going to   die . 
It was the day when the farmer was gathering his   pumpkins in the cornfield , and he just happened to remember the seeds he   had planted in the home - patch , and he got out of his wagon to see what   had become of them . 
"   " Show how it looked , " said the boy . 
But this was just   before her eighty - ninth birthday , and she had drummed up so many sons   and sons - in - law , and daughters and daughters - in - law , and grandsons and   great - grandsons , and granddaughters and great - granddaughters , that the   house was perfectly packed with them . 
The   farmer 's boy went up to his room over the wood - shed , and got in at the   garret window , and brought out the pumpkin - glory . 
"   " Show how they looked ! " said the boy . 
' When he got her close up   he took away his hands , and she gave a kind of a whoop , and then she   began to laugh , the pumpkin - glory _ was _ so funny , and to chase the   funniest papa all round the yard to box his ears , and as soon as she had   boxed them she said , ' Now let 's go in and send the rest out , ' and in   about a quarter of a second all the other papas came out , holding their   hands over the other mothers ' eyes till they got them up to the   pumpkin - glory ; and then there was such a yelling and laughing and   chasing and ear - boxing that you never heard anything like it ; and all at   once the funniest papa hallooed out : ' Where 's gramma ? Gramma 's got to   see it ! Grandma'll enjoy it . 
When the old grandmother got up close ,   it thought it would do something extra to please her ; or else the heat   of the candle had dried it up so that it cracked without intending to . 
  Butterflyflutterby and Flutterbybutterfly   One morning when the papa was on a visit to the grandfather , the nephew   and the niece came rushing into his room and got into bed with him . 
"   " Well , I suppose we ' ve got to wake him up all over again , " said the   niece , with a little sigh ; and they began to pull at the papa this way   and that , but they could not budge him . 
At last the papa said , " This   is a very peculiar kind of a story . 
They rose up and leaned over the papa , with   their arms across and their fluffy heads together in the form of a   capital letter A , and whispered in each other 's ears , " You say it 's one ,   and I 'll say it 's the other , and then we 'll have it right between us . 
But the   General - in - Chief used to go out behind the church and cry , it mortified   him so to have to give such orders , and it reminded him so painfully of   the good old times when he would order his men to charge the enemy , and   cover the field with gore and blood , instead of having it so awfully   spick - and - span as it was now . 
  " And Princess-- "   " Flutterbybutterfly , " said the nephew . 
As there were no children in the royal family except   the twins , the choice of the Khan and Khant naturally fell upon the   Prince-- "   " Butterflyflutterby ! "   " And the Princess-- "   " Flutterbybutterfly ! "   " Correct . 
The whole kingdom was in the most   disgusting state , and whenever the fairy godmother looked into the back   yard of the palace she felt as if she would go through the floor . 
The General   was just going to say that the guns and cannon had all got rusty , and   the powder was spoiled from not having been used for so long , with the   everlasting cleaning up that had been going on ; but the fairy godmother   stamped her foot and sent him flying . 
They tried , shouting out one the one and the   other the other , but the papa said :   " Oh no ! That wo n't work . 
      This fairy tale of a gormandizing people contains no       mention of Thanksgiving Day . 
  Then , taking leave of the King , she and her cat set out for their home . 
  All the churns for twenty miles around began to work in the most lively   manner . 
Mother Mitchel 's tart was to be   the glory of the country , and each one was proud to contribute to such   a great work . 
  The spot which Mother Mitchel had chosen for her great edifice was   a pretty hill on which a plateau formed a splendid site . 
One   would never have expected to find all the thousand pounds of sugar   again . 
With Mother Mitchel there was no such word as _ fail _ . 
  This colossal labour was accomplished in one day , and with wonderful   exactness . 
Behind them stood Mother Mitchel with a box of matches ,   ready to fire each oven as it was filled . 
Then the people of town and country , united by one   rapturous feeling , joined hands , and danced in a ring around the grand   confection . 
Even the babies danced in their nurses '   arms , so precocious was the passion for tarts in this singular country . 
  " ' Tis well ! " said he , " ' tis well ! Wait till to - morrow , my friends ; yes ,   till day after to - morrow , and _ next week _ ! "   The next day the feast still went on gayly ; yet at the evening meal the   King noticed some empty seats . 
Your Majesty ,   for mercy 's sake , a little dry bread ! Oh , a morsel of dry bread , how   good it would be ! "   " No , indeed , " replied the King . 
That day he ordered Mother Mitchel to   make in one of her colossal pots a super - excellent soup of which a bowl   was sent to every family . 
      This tale is evidence that Mrs. Freeman understands       the children of New England as well as she knows their       parents . 
She hugged Thankful , and shook her head ,   with her eyes still staring defiantly into Submit 's hood . 
" I _ know _ our turkey is the biggest , " she said ,   looking lovingly at Thankful , as if to justify herself to her . 
"   " I ' m afraid you ' ve got cold standing out there in the wind . 
" You 'll have to bear more than a cut   thumb if you live . 
  " Father , when are you going to weigh him ? " she asked timidly . 
As soon as   Jonas had laid the turkey back on the shelf and gone out , she watched   her chance and removed the bullets , replacing them in the pewter dish . 
When   Grandfather Thompson was at home , every one deferred to him . 
  " I ' m wickeder than you , " said Submit . 
  The lumber camp on the Featherstone , where he had been at work , had   broken up and gone , and an old shack , deserted by some hunter , and now   standing alone in the great woods , was the only home he could provide   for his little family . 
  The woman 's little glad cry of welcome was changed to one of   apprehension at her husband 's appearance . 
What 'll they think ?   Where is it , Joe ? "   " Do n't ye worry , Nan . 
" The road forks here , and Turner 's is yonder -- less   than a mile . 
"   " You wo n't catch him , either , " said Bates . 
But since they   had carried the young mother away , with her dead baby on her breast , to   place the two in one deep grave together , he had gone steadily downward . 
It 's snug and warm , and there 's a lot of room in it , and we   can put a stove into it and---- " But the rest of Bates 's suggestion was   drowned in a round of applause . 
  The men were now filling up the little space before the shack . 
"   " There , pard , " said Breem , after blowing his nose explosively , " you   just see to wrappin ' up the woman and the kid , and me and Skid , being   as you 're hurt , you know , 'll tote 'em out to the sleigh . 
"   The woman , still smiling happily , was already wrapping up the baby . 
Footpaths and roads were   broken out somewhat in the immediate village , but no farther . 
  " I 'd have you to know , Mistress Betty Belding , " retorted Mistress   Elliott , " that I have a bare quart or so in my jug , and , so far as I   can learn , that is all that the whole town of Colchester has got to   depend upon till the roads or the river can be broken to Norwich . 
She even sent her father to expostulate   with them , but it was of no use . 
  " I tell you what , Obed , " said Miss Hitty , " you ought to see the great   molasses cake which Mistress Elliott has made for Prudence Ann 's   wedding . 
It   was , of course , supposed that the calf had devoured the whole of the   mighty cake as well as the pies . 
  " Let us gather the fruits of our first labours and rejoice together , "   said Governor Bradford . 
They   little thought that Monday would afterward be kept as washday . 
  And then there was gentle Dorothy , wife of Governor Bradford , who had   fallen overboard from the _ Mayflower _ in Provincetown harbour while her   husband was coasting along the bleak shore in search of a place for a   home . 
"   This was true , with restrictions , for enough enamel was gone from the   face to make the exact location of the hour an uncertain thing ; and   there were days , when the wind was in the east , when the hour hand   needed periodical assistance . 
  Miltiades was a big gobbler now , and had a right to be named Ishmael ,   for his hand was against all men . 
" Do n't   let him get all the line on you ! He 's hooked ! Snub him ! snub him ! "   The whir of the reel deadened now , and the stride of Miltiades was   perceptibly lessened and then became but a vigorous up - and - down hop ,   while the tense line sang in the gentle autumn breeze . 
" Do n't be afraid ! I reckon he 'll stop when   he gets to the pole ! "   Those of us who knew Miltiades at his best have doubts as to this , but ,   fortunately , it was not put to the test . 
  " I believe he did forget that wagon , " said the heaven - born inventor ;   " he 's perfectly capable of it . 
" And Eph   put the steaming platter on the table . 
  The heaven - born inventor 's face widened in beatified smiles of   expectation at this , but Eph looked him sternly in the eye . 
"   Conversation at this time began to turn on high and solemn culinary   mysteries and receipts of wondrous power and virtue . 
  Thanksgiving now was dawning ! We children poked one another , and   fairly giggled with unreproved delight as we listened to the crackle   of the slowly unfolding document . 
Then out we would all fly at the   kitchen door , like sparks from a blacksmith 's window . 
There , frozen solid , and thus well preserved   in their icy fetters , they formed a great repository for all the winter   months ; and the pies baked at Thanksgiving often came out fresh and   good with the violets of April . 
  " Now , " says my Aunt Lois , " I s'pose we ' ve got to have Betty Poganut   and Sally Wonsamug , and old Obscue and his wife , and the whole tribe   down , roosting around our doors till we give 'em something . 
  Wal , come ' long to Josh Bissel 's tahvern , there at the Halfway House ,   you know , ' twas so swingeing cold we stopped to take a little suthin '   warmin ' , an ' we sort o ' sot an ' sot over the fire , till , fust we knew ,   we kind o ' got asleep ; an ' when we woke up we found we 'd left the old   General hitched up t ' th ' post pretty much all night . 
Now she 'll   be jest as cross as she can be , 'cause this ' ere ai n't _ our _ turkey ,   and these ' ere ai n't our pies . 
  It takes some hours to get a room warm where a family never sits ,   and which therefore has not in its walls one particle of the genial   vitality which comes from the indwelling of human beings . 
      " He bids us make his glories known ,          His works of power and grace . 
  In the evening the house was all open and lighted with the best of   tallow candles , which Aunt Lois herself had made with especial care for   this illumination . 
  But I assure you my grandmother was not a woman to be laughed at ; for   whatever she once set on foot she " put through " with a sturdy energy   befitting a daughter of the Puritans . 
  " But it wo n't come true , " replied Donald , " because you have the little   end . 
"   " Come along , " replied the gobbler , with a provoked air , " and let your   lessons go until to - morrow , when you will have plenty of light . 
  " Take his bean shooter from his pocket , " suggested another bird , " and   let 's have a shot at him . 
"   " What could I do but eat turkey when it was put on the table ? "   protested Donald . 
  " What makes you think so ? " asked Donald , with a laugh . 
  " Because he 's a skinflint , I tell you , " asserted Patem , " though I do   believe he says that he was brought here from Holland as one of the   Company 's men , and ought not therefore pay taxes to the Company . 
  " Well , " cried several of the boys almost in a breath , " and now what   shall we do , Patem ? You have us in a pretty fix . 
Thump , thump , thump , across   the floor went the wooden leg with its silver bands , and with every   thump the Heer Governor grew still more puzzled and angered . 
  The sentry at the door would have sent them off without further ado ,   but , hearing their noise , the Heer Governor came to the door . 
The States of Holland after establishing their freedom from Spain   had , in the year 1609 , celebrated their deliverance from tyranny " by   thanksgiving and hearty prayers , " and had thus really first instituted   the custom of an official thanksgiving . 
He was hasty and   overbearing though high - minded , loyal , and brave , but he never could   " get on " with the ways and pranks of boys . 
  " _ Ach , so _ , " cried young Teuny Vanderbreets , as the disgusted and   disconsolate six gathered in the roadway and looked at one another   ruefully . 
  Still , worn out as she was , when her thirty sons and daughters   clustered round , and begged that they might have their usual family   dinner on Thanksgiving Day , she could not find it in her hospitable   heart to refuse , and immediately invitations were sent to her eleven   brothers and sisters , old Father Time , and Mother Year , to come with   all their families and celebrate the great American holiday . 
But I really   feared we should not get here to - day ; for when we came to dress I found   nearly everything we had was lent ; so that must account for our shabby   appearance . 
  The little Novembers , meanwhile , were having a charming time with their   favourite cousins , the Decembers , who were always so gay and jolly ,   and had such a delightful papa . 
  Independence , the fourth child of Mr. July , who is a bold little   fellow , and a fine speaker , gave them an oration he had learned at   school ; and the Augusts suggested games of tag and blindman 's buff ,   which they all enjoyed heartily . 
Just as they got to the railway station the train came whizzing   in . 
  " Silly Mary Virginia ! " said John , and Mary Virginia began to cry . 
  Then they all called together : " Grandfather ! Grandfather ! Grandfather ! "   and when nobody heard that , they began to feel frightened and lonely . 
As a tale of the harvest , it       deserves to be included in this collection . 
" And Naomi said to her , " Go , my daughter . 
  An old man , with a face that looked pinched , and who was dressed in a   seedy black coat and a much - battered stovepipe hat , stopped at the same   doorway , and , with one hand on the latch , appeared to hesitate between   hunger and a sense of poverty before going in . 
"   " But , see here ! " And Bert showed the two cents , offering to return one . 
Poor people , if they behave themselves ,   are just as respectable to me as rich folks . 
  " I have n't been with her now for two years , hardly at all since father   died . 
You wo n't ? A cup of tea , then , to go with your pie ? "   " I think I _ will _ have a cup of tea ; you are _ so _ kind , " said the old   man . 
You 'll find me in very humble quarters ;   but you are not aristocratic , you say . 
  " To think of _ me _ inviting _ you _ to dinner ! " the boy cried , abashed and   ashamed . 
He had sent the sunshine and the rain and caused the   grains and fruits and vegetables to grow . 
One of the group was John   Inglefield 's son , who had been bred at college , and was now a student   of theology at Andover . 
If she had spent the many months of her absence   in guilt and infamy , yet they seemed to have left no traces on her   gentle aspect . 
At first she was restrained by mingled grief   and shame , and by a dread that Prudence was too much changed to respond   to her affection , or that her own purity would be felt as a reproach   by the lost one . 
John Inglefield 's   rough visage brightened with the glow of his heart , as it grew warm   and merry within him ; once or twice , even , he laughed till the room   rang again , yet seemed startled by the echo of his own mirth . 
Her visit to the Thanksgiving fireside was the realization   of one of those waking dreams in which the guilty soul will sometimes   stray back to its innocence . 
  But he knew that his mother valued it highly because Uncle Obie gave it   to him and because there were little dents in it made by his vigorous   first teeth ; so he always returned it to the box with a sigh of   resignation , and made the most of the twenty - five cents given him by   his father on the great days of the year . 
  " I declare , Mary ! " said Mr. Waddle . 
  " It leaves Thanksgiving out in the cold , does n't it , Bub ? But we 'll   make it up at Christmas , maybe , " said Mr. Waddle , as Obadiah turned to   go . 
If there was       no hole in the dollar you gave me when I was a baby I       would take it and buy something for Thanksgiving . 
The fortunate owners of lock boxes took out their   letters with a proud air while the distributing was still going on . 
  Obadiah unwrapped one of these round , flat objects , and even in the   dull light of the drizzling and fading November day he could see that   it was a bright , clean , shining silver dollar -- and had no hole in it . 
  " Oh , that blessed brother ! " cried Mrs. Waddle , wiping her eyes with her   apron . 
  MARY ELLEN was coming home from her school teaching at the Falls , and   Nahum from ' tending in Blodgett 's store at Edom Four Corners , and Uncle   and Aunt Piper with Mirandy and Augustus and the twins were coming from   Juniper Hill , and there was every prospect of as merry a Thanksgiving   as one could wish to see . 
  " You do n't care because the new minister and his daughter are coming ? "   pursued Minty . 
" She could n't -- she would n't ! Oh ,   Jason , Cyrus wo n't do it , will he ? "   " Has n't he got to if she says so ? " demanded Jason grimly . 
  " Cyrus is gettin ' real handy and accommodatin ' , " said Clorinda the next   morning , when they were all in the kitchen , and Jason , ignobly arrayed   in Clorinda 's kitchen - belle apron , was chopping , and Minty was seeding   raisins . 
"   " Yes'm , " answered Jason hoarsely , without lifting his eyes from his   plate . 
" There ! I ' most forgot my sauce dishes , and   Sabriny 's going to have company to - morrow ! "   Minty drew a long breath of relief as the carriage disappeared down the   lane , and Jason privately confided to her his opinion that she was " an   orfle smart girl . 
And Aunt Kittredge was quite   capable of asking the minister 's daughter to return it . 
I ' m sure she can explain , " pleaded the   minister 's daughter . 
  " I 'll stand by you , Mint , feather and all . 
"   " There ! Now you see what you ' ve done , Maria ! I declare I would n't   gredge givin ' a twenty dollar bill to fetch that white turkey back ! "   exclaimed Uncle Kittredge . 
  " Why did n't you buy some blue ones ? I 'd rather have them different , " he   said . 
And I 'd hate to have my mother make pies and send me about   to sell them . 
Do n't you want to   play ? I 'll let you turn the paring machine if you 'd like that best . 
  Martin Poyser had some faint conception of the flavour such men must   find in hot roast beef and fresh - drawn ale . 
) During the first and second quatrain , sung decidedly   _ forte _ , no can was filled :       " Here 's a health unto our master ,          The founder of the feast ;        Here 's a health unto our master          And to our mistress !       " And may his doings prosper ,          Whate'er he takes in hand ,        For we are all his servants ,          And are at his command . 
At last Tim 's next neighbour , Ben Tholoway , began   to give emphasis to his speech by nudges , at which Tim , growing rather   savage , said , " Let me alooan , will ye ? else I 'll ma ' ye sing a toon ye   wonna like . 
"   So Freddie , all excitement , rushed upstairs and into his mother 's room ,   shouting as we have read . 
"   At once Freddie became fired with the desire to rush to a store ,   purchase a doll , and send it off to the little " black house . 
  There was no time to lose if the doll was to be sent for Christmas , so   both letters were written that very evening and Freddie begged to put   them in the post box himself that there might be no mistake in that . 
Last year he and his wife started in on       taking summer boarders and I guess they done first       rate . 
" Freddie thought she should have skates and a watch and bracelets   and one of the cunning waterproof cloaks and a trunk -- in fact ,   everything that could be bought for a doll ( and in these days that   means all articles of apparel , whether for use or ornament , that could   be bought for a real person ) ; but Mrs. Page explained that she would   not need so many things in Mad River Village , so he was contented with   a trunk which he selected himself , while his mother and Beth bought   a little hat and cloak , shoes , stockings , and a pretty sunshade -- the   dresses and underclothing Beth thought she could make with the aid of   her mother 's seamstress , and she was very ambitious to try . 
They felt very proud and happy when   the box was finally nailed up and directed in clear printed letters to       GEORGE TILLAGE ,         Intervale Farm ,             Mad River Village ,                  New Hampshire . 
What a miser'ble Thanksgivin ' this has been ! They do n't   know what Thanksgivin ' is out this way . 
The ground is frozen   hard ; we stub our toes on the frozen ruts in the road . 
  We run races an ' play snap the whip , an ' cut all sorts o ' didoes , an '   we never mind the pick'rel weed that is froze in on the ice an ' trips   us up every time we cut the outside edge ; an ' then we boys jump over   the air holes , an ' the girls stan ' by an ' scream an ' tell us they know   we 're agoin ' to drownd ourselves . 
There   is bustle everywhere , the rattle uv pans an ' the clatter of dishes ; an '   the new kitchen stove begins to warm up an ' git red , till Helen loses   her wits and is flustered , an ' sez she never could git the hang o ' that   stove 's dampers . 
Some folks say he sings wonderful well , but _ I _ do n't like Sam 's   voice . 
Two long tables   have been made into one , and one of the big tablecloths Gran'ma had   when she set up housekeepin ' is spread over 'em both . 
The ol' folks play with the young   folks just as nat'ral as can be ; and we all laugh when Deacon Hosea   Cowles hez to measure six yards of love ribbon with Miss Hepsey Newton ,   and cut each yard with a kiss ; for the deacon hez been sort o ' purrin '   round Miss Hepsey for goin' on two years . 
Jest as if Mother does n't know ! Of course she does ; an '   when Mother kisses Laura good - bye that night there is in the act a   tenderness that speaks more sweetly than even Mother 's words . 
" It was the shy little voice of Heart 's   Delight . 
" At the mere thought of which   he frowned more and more , and uttered words of complaint against the   heavens , because there was no rain ; against the earth , because it was   so dry and unyielding ; against the corn , because it had not sprung up . 
  Meantime , the corn seeds had been found ready and waiting when the   hour came , and the young sprouts burst out at once ; and very soon all   along the long ridges were to be seen rows of tender blades , tinting   the whole field with a delicate green . 
  And so they went home together , no more being said by either ; for , as   she turned round , the sight of the setting sun and of the young freshly   growing wheat blades brought tears into her eyes . 
At which words the   Master of the Harvest stopped short , amazed , to look at his wife , for   her soul was growing stronger as her body grew weaker , and she dared to   say things now which she would have had no courage to utter before . 
  And the voice of his discontent was breathed over the cornfield , all   along the long ridges where the plants were labouring , and waiting , and   watching . 
But whether he prayed for either the corn   or her that night she never knew . 
  And the poor sick wife , as she watched , said to those around her that   the weather was gradually changing , and that all would come right at   last ; and sighing a prayer that it might be so with herself also , she   had her Bible brought to the bed , and wrote in the flyleaf the text ,   " Some thirty , some sixty , some an hundredfold " ; and after the text the   date of the day , for on that day the sun had been shining steadily for   many hours . 
And more and more as he prayed for help ,   that the weary struggle might be blessed , and the newborn watching and   waiting not be in vain , so more and more there came over his spirit a   yearning for that other harvest , where he and she who had gone before   might be gathered in together . 
  " Come , my son , " said Doctor Goodwin , as they entered the meeting - house ,   " you are to sit in the front seat with grandma this morning : she is   particularly anxious to hear every word of the sermon to - day . 
Pretty soon a wee creature dressed all in soft brown   stole across the floor of a certain pew . 
There is plenty of humour in this tale of a       turkey hunt . 
"   " I ai n't got no ill - will in my heart for Dick , " replied Grandpa Davis ,   " but he is too everlastin ' hard - headed to knock under , and I 'll be   blamed if I go more'n halfway toward makin ' up . 
It   seemed almost a desecration of the happy past to hunt there now alone . 
He wondered how many were in   the flock , and called once more . 
"   " I knowed you would , Billy , afore your fired , " Grandpa Dun replied ,   with mock gravity , " but that do n't cut no figger . 
  Seating themselves upon a fallen hickory log , they chewed and   expectorated , recalling old times , and enjoying their laugh with the   careless freedom of their childhood days . 
"   A THANKSGIVING DINNER THAT FLEW AWAY       A Cape Cod story about a wise old gander whose       adventure on the sea insured him against the perils of       the Thanksgiving hatchet . 
It was coming toward me , and   faster and faster as it approached . 
I was   expecting you , and had been looking out for you , but missed sight of   you . 
" Oh , oh ! "   The bridegroom cried " Shoo ! " but he might as well have said " Shoo "   to a steam engine . 
'   " It seemed best , and he made preparations to go . 
  " It was full of an Indian - summer brightness after the long storms . 
  " I was certain that he was the gander I had raised and that Nathaniel   had lifted into the air when he gave me his last recognition from the   top of the hill . 
While he rambled through the woods , he   felt a strong desire to know how the plants , herbs , and berries grew   without any aid from man , and why it was that some species were good   to eat and others possessed medicinal or poisonous juices . 
Be strong , my friend , for this is   the only way you can overcome me , and obtain the boon you seek . 
"   At the usual hour of the day the sky visitor returned , and the trial   of strength was renewed . 
The   whole family then united in feast on the newly grown ears , expressing   gratitude to the Merciful Spirit who gave it . 
  " Oh , I told her I thought potpie smelled a good deal like turkey , " said   Jessie , and again both laughed . 
Nothing was said about them , either , and   it was not Thanksgiving nor Christmas , though it was only a few days   before the former . 
"   But that box of goodies ! Let us see where it went . 
The table was at one end of the bench ,   the table service two jackknives and two iron spoons -- absolutely   nothing else . 
Mechanically Jack sought the tools to open it ,   and in a few moments the cover was off . 
It began :       DEAR JACK:--I've just found out where you are , and       I ' m so glad . 
  These thoughts and many more surged through his mind that long   afternoon , and when Tom returned as the shadows were growing long , he   sat exactly as he had been left . 
She tried hard to sober   herself now and then by the thought , " Perhaps he wo n't come , " but she   could n't stay sobered , for she felt as certain that he would as that   she lived . 
Polly Pine   swept the rooms with her tiny broom and dusted them . 
" In a minute he was gone -- nobody knew   where . 
She ate her supper with hearty   appetite , said her prayers with John , and curled down on the featherbed   in the cart , while John heaped on more wood , and , shouldering his   musket , went to lengthen the ropes that tethered his oxen , and then   mounted guard over the camp . 
  John had built a sawmill on the brook a little way from the house ,   and already owned a flourishing trade , for the settlement about the   lake from which Nepasset Brook sprung was quite large , and till John   Perkins went there the lumber had been all drawn fifteen miles off , to   Litchfield , and his mill was only three miles from Nepash village . 
Parson Everett was childless , and in two years ' time both he and   his wife adored the gentle , graceful girl ; and she loved them dearly . 
The corn tasselled , the wheat ears filled well ,   the potatoes hung out rich clusters of their delicate and graceful   blossoms , beans straggled half over the garden , the hens did their duty   bravely , and the cow produced a heifer calf . 
  Sylvia would always remember how once , when she was looking at Mount   Tahconic , darkened by a brooding tempest , its crags frowning blackly   above the dark forest at its foot and the lurid cloud above its head   torn by fierce lances of light , she hid her head in her mother 's   checked apron , in the helpless terror of an imaginative child ; but ,   instead of being soothed and pitied , mother had only laughed a little   gay laugh , and said gently , but merrily :   " Why , Sylvy , the sun 's right on the other side , only you do n't see it . 
That kind o '   text comes home these times , I tell ye . 
Hannah regained courage , wondering how she could have lost   heart so far , and said to Dolly , as they washed up the supper dishes :   " I guess we 'll keep together , Dolly . 
The words of thankfulness she wanted to speak would have   been so many stabs in that woman 's breast . 
She   liked Sylvia at first , but became frantically jealous of her as soon as   she suspected her son 's attachment . 
  One night , as she sat knitting by the fire , a special messenger from   Litchfield rode up to the door and brought stirring news . 
  " So you shall , Joe , and dance ' Money Musk ' all night , if you want   to -- same as you did to the corn huskin ' . 
It 's kind of buff - coloured ground ,   flowered all over with roses , deep - red roses , as nateral as life . 
Mahala Green   had already arrived , for she was dressmaker as well as tailoress , and   was sponging and pressing over the black paduasoy that had once been   dove - coloured and was Hannah 's sole piece of wedding finery , handed   down from her grandmother 's wardrobe at that . 
  But the pung was ready , and Sam 's howls had to die out uncomforted . 
" I wanted a muslin gown ; but madam had   laid this by long ago , and I could not thwart or grieve her , she is so   very good to me . 
  " Let us pray ! " said he , in a loud but broken voice ; and holding fast   to the back of the chair , he poured out his soul and theirs before the   Lord with all the fervour and the fluency of real feeling . 
The shade of anxiety in madam 's eye was caused only by a doubt   as to the sufficiency of her supplies for three unexpected and ravenous   guests ; but a look at the mighty turkey , the crisp roast pig , the   cold ham , the chicken pie , and the piles of smoking vegetables , with   a long vista of various pastries , apples , nuts , and pitchers of cider   on the buffet , and an inner consciousness of a big Indian pudding , for   twenty - four hours simmering in the pot over the fire , reassured her ,   and perhaps heartened up the parson , for after a long grace he still   kept his feet and added , with a kindly smile :   " Brethren and friends , you are heartily welcome . 
So of the brooding hens at the settler 's barn :   the eggs would not hatch , and the hens , too , it is said , gave up laying   eggs , perhaps from lack of food . 
As a result of it , young Jonathan   Edwards and my then equally youthful Great - uncle Nathaniel set off the   next day to drive to Brunswick with a span of old white horses hitched   in a farm wagon without springs , carrying four rather poor sheep , four   bushels of barley , and fifteen pounds of wool , which they hoped to   exchange for five bushels of that precious corn . 
" It 's a bear I guess , " and he   snatched up the empty gun to reload it . 
Both animals were now tearing   along the brink of the deep stream , stumbling headlong one second , up   the next , plunging on . 
Another hoarse   snort and a splash of the water was the response from across the stream .
