In _ The London Chronicle _ for December 19 - -January 1, 1765 - -the  following advertisement appeared:--   " The Philosophers, Politicians, Necromancers, and the Learned in every    Faculty are desired to observe that on the 1st of January, being New    Year's Day ( Oh, that we may all lead new Lives! ), Mr Newbery intends    to publish the following important volumes, bound and gilt, and hereby    invites all his little friends who are good to call for them at the    Bible and Sun, in St Paul's Churchyard : but those who are naughty are    to have none. this Book written, is I really guilty from not inviting more gentlemen over our heads?
