In _ The London Chronicle _ for December 19 - -January 1 , 1765 - -the  following advertisement appeared:--   " The Philosophers , Politicians , Necromancers , and the Learned in every    Faculty are desired to observe that on the 1st of January , being New    Year 's Day ( Oh , that we may all lead new Lives ! ) , Mr Newbery intends    to publish the following important volumes , bound and gilt , and hereby    invites all his little friends who are good to call for them at the    Bible and Sun , in St Paul 's Churchyard : but those who are naughty are    to have none .
"[A ]  Many of these little books have been doubtless long since forgotten ,  though they did not deserve such a fate ; but the name of " Goody Two  Shoes " is still familiar to the ears of English children , though the  book itself may be unknown to thousands of little ones of this later  generation .
