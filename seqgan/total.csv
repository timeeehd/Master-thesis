" "" Goody Two Shoes "" was published in April 1765 , and few nursery books  have had a wider circulation , or have retained their position so long .  The number of editions that have been published both in England and  America is legion , and it has appeared in mutilated versions under the  auspices of numerous publishing houses in London and the provinces ,  although of late years there have been no new issues . Even in 1802 ,  Charles Lamb in writing to Coleridge , said--   "" "" Goody Two Shoes "" is almost out of print . Mrs Barbauld 's stuff has    banished all the old classics of the nursery , and the shopman at    Newbery 's hardly deigned to reach them off an old exploded corner of    a shelf , when Mary asked for them . Mrs Barbauld 's and Mrs Trimmer 's    nonsense lay in piles about . Knowledge , insignificant and vapid as Mrs    Barbauld 's books convey , it seems must come to a child in the shape of    knowledge ; and his empty noddle must be turned with conceit of his own    powers when he has learnt that a horse is an animal , and Billy is    better than a horse , and such like , instead of that beautiful interest    in wild tales , which made the child a man , while all the time he    suspected himself to be no bigger than a child . Science has succeeded    to poetry no less in the little walks of children than with men . Is    there no possibility of averting this sore evil ? Think what you would    have been now , if instead of being fed with tales and old wives '    fables in childhood , you had been crammed with geography and natural    history !   "" Hang them!--I mean the cursed Barbauld crew , those blights and blasts    of all that is human in man and child . ""[B ]  There must , however , be many parents still living who remember the  delight that the little story gave them in their younger days , and  they will , no doubt , be pleased to see it once more in the form which  was then so familiar to them . The children of to - day , too , will look  on it with some curiosity , on account of the fact that it is one of  the oldest of our nursery tales , and amused and edified their  grand - parents and great grand - parents when they were children , while  they can not fail to be attracted by its simple , pretty , and  interesting story .         *        *        *        *        *  The question of the authorship"	1	0
" We find , however , in Nichol 's Literary Anecdotes , that   "" It is not perhaps generally known that to Mr Griffith Jones , and a    brother of his , Mr Giles Jones , in conjunction with Mr John Newbery ,    the public are indebted for the origin of those numerous and popular    little books for the amusement and instruction of children which have    been ever since received with universal approbation . The Lilliputian    histories of Goody Two Shoes , Giles Gingerbread , Tommy Trip , & c. , & c. ,    are remarkable proofs of the benevolent minds of the projectors of    this plan of instruction , and respectable instances of the    accommodation of superior talents to the feeble intellects of    infantine felicity . ""  Mr Giles Jones was the grandfather of the late Mr Winter Jones ,  formerly the Principal Librarian of the British Museum , and the book  is attributed to the first - named gentleman in the catalogue of the  British Museum . It is claimed also that the book offers internal  evidence in support of Mr Giles Jones ' authorship , inasmuch as Goody  Two Shoes becomes Lady Jones , and one of the prominent families in the  book is also named Jones .  Beyond this , however , there appears to be no evidence as to Mr Giles  Jones being the writer , and I think something may be said as to the  claim on behalf of the poet Goldsmith , although I am by no means  anxious that the honour of having written it should be ascribed either  to the one or to the other : the following remarks , which are mainly  taken from an article I contributed to the _ Athen√¶um _ in April  1881 , are offered simply as speculations which may not be without  interest to lovers of the little book . They may , perhaps , show that  there is some reason for attributing the work to Oliver Goldsmith ,  although , of course , it is not claimed that they absolutely establish  the fact .  Having occasion to examine carefully as many of the books for children  published by John Newbery as I could procure ( and they are as scarce  as blackberries in midwinter , for what among books has so brief a life  as a nursery book ? ) , I was struck while perusing them with a certain  distinct literary flavour , so to speak , which appeared to be common to  a group of little volumes , all published about the same period . These  were : "" Goody Two Shoes , "" "" Giles Gingerbread , "" "" Tom Thumb 's Folio , ""  "" The Lilliputian Magazine , "" "" The Lilliputian Masquerade"	1	0
"This group of little books  possesses , moreover , another characteristic that is sufficiently  remarkable of itself to be noticed . While they all evince a real  genius for writing in a style suited to the capacities of little folk ,  there is a nameless something about them which , far more than is the  case with thousands of other books for the young , is calculated to  enforce the attention and excite the interest of "" children of a larger  growth . ""  Now one of this little group , "" The Lilliputian Magazine , "" is  attributed in the British Museum Catalogue to Oliver Goldsmith ; and so  strong is the family likeness in all the books I have mentioned , that  I can not but believe they are all by the same hand -- a belief which I  think will be shared by any one who will take the trouble to compare  them carefully . But I should advise him to rely on the Newbery  editions alone , for grievously garbled versions of nearly every one of  these books have been issued from many different houses throughout the  country .  Many authorities have supported the view that Goldsmith was the author  of "" Goody Two Shoes . "" Conspicuous among them was Washington Irving ,  who says , "" It is suggested with great probability that he wrote for Mr  Newbery the famous nursery story of ' Goody Two Shoes . ' "" It is said  also that William Godwin held this opinion ; and I believe there is  authority for stating that the Misses Bewick , the daughters of the  celebrated engraver , who illustrated an edition of the book for T.  Saint , of Newcastle , understood from their father that it was by  Oliver Goldsmith .  But let us turn to the book itself and see if it furnishes any  evidence on the point . The very title , with its quaint phrasing , shows  no common genius , and as Washington Irving says , "" bears the stamp of  his [ Goldsmith 's ] sly and playful humour . "" As the book was published  in 1765 , it would most likely have been written just at the time when  Goldsmith was working most industriously in the service of Newbery  ( 1763 - 4 ) , at which period it will be remembered that he was living  near Newbery at Islington , and his publisher was paying for his board  and lodging .  Without , of course , claiming that similarity of idea in different  writings necessarily betokens the same authorship , I think the  parallels that are to be found in this little book , with many of the  sentiments in Oliver Goldsmith 's"	1	0
"In describing the parish of Mouldwell , where  little Margery was born , an exact picture is drawn of "" The Deserted  Village , "" where    One only master grasps the whole domain    And half a tillage tints thy smiling plain ;  And where    ---- the man of wealth and pride    Takes up a space that many a poor supplied :    Space for his lakes his park 's extended bounds ,    Space for his horses , equipage , and hounds .  And by this and other tyrannies , and being also    Scourged by famine from the smiling land ,  for he was "" unfortunate in his business "" at about the same time , Sir  Timothy accomplishes his aim , and    Indignant spurns the cottage from the green .  Ruined by this oppression , poor Mr Meanwell is turned out of doors ,  and flew to another parish for succour .    Where , then , ah ! where shall poverty reside    To ' scape the pressure of contiguous pride ?  Sir Timothy , however , suffers for his injustice and wickedness , for  "" great part of the land lay untilled for some years , which was deemed  a just reward for such diabolical proceedings . ""    Ill fares the land , to hastening ills a prey ,    Where wealth accumulates and men decay .  Miss Charlotte Yonge , to whom I shall refer again , lays upon this : "" If  the conjecture be true which attributes this tale to Oliver Goldsmith ,  we have seen the same spirit which prompted his poem of ' The Deserted  Village , ' namely , indignation and dismay at the discouragement of  small holdings in the early part of the eighteenth century . ""[C ]  Indeed , it may well be that we have in this preface even a more true  picture of Lissoy than that given in the poem , which , as Mr William  Black says in his monograph on Goldsmith , "" is there seen through the  softening and beautifying mist of years . ""  Much more might be said of the characteristics of this little book ,  which contains so much that reminds us not only of the style but the  matter of many of Goldsmith 's writings . Miss Yonge says : "" There is a  certain dry humour in some passages and a tenderness in others that  incline us much to the belief that it could come from no one else but  the writer of ' The Vicar of Wakefield ' and ' The Deserted Village . '  Indeed , we could almost imagine that Dr Primrose himself had described  the panic at the supposed ghost in the church in the same tone as the "	1	0
"       _ How and about Little _ Margery _ and her _ Brother .  Care and Discontent shortened the Days of Little _ Margery 's _  Father.--He was forced from his Family , and seized with a violent  Fever in a Place where Dr. _ James 's _ Powder was not to be had ,  and where he died miserably . _ Margery 's _ poor Mother survived the  Loss of her Husband but a few Days , and died of a broken Heart ,  leaving _ Margery _ and her little Brother to the wide World ; but ,  poor Woman , it would have melted your Heart to have seen how  frequently she heaved up her Head , while she lay speechless , to survey  with languishing Looks her little Orphans , as much as to say , _ Do  Tommy , do Margery , come with me _ . They cried , poor Things , and she  sighed away her Soul ; and I hope is happy .  It would both have excited your Pity , and have done your Heart good ,  to have seen how fond these two little ones were of each other , and  how , Hand in Hand , they trotted about . Pray see them .  They were both very ragged , and _ Tommy _ had two Shoes , but  _ Margery _ had but one . They had nothing , poor Things , to support  them ( not being in their own Parish ) but what they picked from the  Hedges , or got from the poor People , and they lay every Night in a  Barn . Their Relations took no Notice of them ; no , they were rich , and  ashamed to own such a poor little ragged Girl as _ Margery _ , and  such a dirty little curl - pated Boy as _ Tommy _ . Our Relations and  Friends seldom take Notice of us when we are poor ; but as we grow rich  they grow fond . And this will always be the Case , while People love  Money better than Virtue , or better than they do GOD Almighty . But  such wicked Folks , who love nothing but Money , and are proud and  despise the Poor , never come to any good in the End , as we shall see  by and by .                                CHAP . II .                     _ How and about Mr. _ Smith .  Mr. _ Smith _ was a very worthy Clergyman , who lived in the Parish  where Little _ Margery _ and _ Tommy _ were born ; and having a  Relation come to see him , who was a charitable good Man , he sent for  these Children to
Pray look at him .  After some Days the Gentleman intended to go to _ London _ , and  take little _ Tommy _ with him , of whom you will know more by and  by , for we shall at a proper Time present you with some Part of his  History , his Travels and Adventures .  The Parting between these two little Children was very affecting ,  _ Tommy _ cried , and _ Margery _ cried , and they kissed each  other an hundred Times . At last _ Tommy _ thus wiped off her Tears  with the End of his Jacket , and bid her cry no more , for that he would  come to her again , when he returned from Sea . However , as they were so  very fond , the Gentleman would not suffer them to take Leave of each  other ; but told _ Tommy _ he should ride out with him , and come  back at Night . When night came , Little _ Margery _ grew very uneasy  about her Brother , and after sitting up as late as Mr. _ Smith _  would let her , she went crying to Bed .                                CHAP . III .           _ How Little _ Margery _ obtained the Name of _          Goody Two - Shoes , _ and what happened in the Parish . _  As soon as Little _ Margery _ got up in the Morning , which was very  early , she ran all round the Village , crying for her Brother ; and  after some Time returned greatly distressed . However , at this Instant ,  the Shoemaker very opportunely came in with the new Shoes , for which  she had been measured by the Gentleman 's Order .  Nothing could have supported Little _ Margery _ under the  Affliction she was in for the Loss of her Brother , but the Pleasure  she took in her _ two Shoes _ . She ran out to Mrs. _ Smith _ as  soon as they were put on , and stroking down her ragged Apron thus ,  cried out , _ Two Shoes , Mame , see two Shoes _ . And so she behaved  to all the People she met , and by that Means obtained the Name of  _ Goody Two - Shoes _ , though her Playmates called her _ Old Goody  Two - Shoes _ .  Little _ Margery _ was very happy in being with Mr. and Mrs.  _ Smith _ , who were very charitable and good to her , and had agreed  to breed her up with their Family ; but as soon as that Tyrant of the  Parish , that _ Graspall _ , heard of her being
 Mrs. _ Smith _ was also greatly concerned at being thus obliged to  discard poor Little _ Margery _ . She kissed her and cried ; as also  did Mr. _ Smith _ , but they were obliged to send her away ; for the  People who had ruined her Father could at any Time have ruined them .                                CHAP . IV .              _ How Little _ Margery _ learned to read ,                    and by Degrees taught others . _  Little _ Margery _ saw how good , and how wise Mr. _ Smith _ was ,  and concluded , that this was owing to his great Learning , therefore  she wanted of all Things to learn to read . For this Purpose she used  to meet the little Boys and Girls as they came from School , borrow  their Books , and sit down and read till they returned ;  By this Means she soon got more Learning than any of her Playmates ,  and laid the following Scheme for instructing those who were more  ignorant than herself . She found , that only the following Letters were  required to spell all the Words in the World ; but as some of these  Letters are large and some small , she with her Knife cut out of  several Pieces of Wood ten Setts of each of these :                      a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o                      p q r   ( s )   s t u v w x y z.  [ Post - processor 's note : ( s ) is an old - English style non - terminating  letter  s "" . ]                         And six Setts of these :                       A B C D E F G H I K L M N O                          P Q R S T U V W X Y Z.  And having got an old Spelling - Book , she made her Companions set up  all the Words they wanted to spell , and after that she taught them to  compose Sentences . You know what a Sentence is , my Dear , _ I will be  good _ , is a Sentence ; and is made up , as you see , of several Words .  The usual Manner of Spelling , or carrying on the Game , as they called  it , was this : Suppose the Word to be spelt was Plumb Pudding ( and who  can suppose a better ) the Children were placed in a Circle , and the  first brought the Letter _ P _ , the next _ l _ , the next _ u _ , the next  _ m _ , and so on till the Whole was spelt ; and"	1	0
" I once went her Rounds with her , and was highly diverted , as you may  be , if you please to look into the next Chapter .                                 CHAP . V.         _ How Little _ Two - Shoes _ became a trotting Tutoress                  and how she taught her young Pupils . _  It was about seven o'Clock in the Morning when we set out on this  important Business , and the first House we came to was Farmer  _ Wilson 's _ . See here it is .  Here _ Margery _ stopped , and ran up to the Door , _ Tap , tap , tap _ . Who 's  there ? Only little goody _ Two - Shoes _ , answered _ Margery _ , come to  teach _ Billy _ . Oh Little _ Goody _ , says Mrs. _ Wilson _ , with Pleasure in  her Face , I am glad to see you , _ Billy _ wants you sadly , for he has  learned all his Lesson . Then out came the little Boy . _ How do doody  Two - Shoes _ , says he , not able to speak plain . Yet this little Boy had  learned all his Letters ; for she threw down this Alphabet mixed  together thus :                      b d f h k m o q s u w y z [ f ]                      a c e g i l n p r t v x j  and he picked them up , called them by their right Names , and put them  all in order thus :                      a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o                      p q r   ( s )   s t u v w x y z.  [ Post - processor 's note : ( s ) is an old - English style non - terminating  letter "" s "" . ]  She then threw down the Alphabet of Capital Letters in the Manner you  here see them .                        B D F H K M O Q S U W Y Z                        A C E G I L N P R T V X J.  and he picked them all up , and having told their Names , placed them  thus :                        A B C D E F G H I J K L M                        N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z.  Now , pray little Reader , take this Bodkin , and see if you can point  out the Letters from these mixed Alphabets , and tell how they should  be placed as well as little Boy _ Billy _ .  The next Place we came to was Farmer _ Simpson 's _ ,"	1	0
Sirrah , says his  Mistress , what do you bark at Little _ Two - Shoes _ . Come in  _ Madge _ ; here , _ Sally _ wants you sadly , she has learned all  her Lesson . Then out came the little one : So _ Madge ! _ say she ; so  _ Sally ! _ answered the other , have you learned your Lesson ? Yes ,  that 's what I have , replied the little one in the Country Manner ; and  immediately taking the Letters she set up these Syllables :                      ba be bi bo bu , ca ce ci co cu                      da de di do du , fa fe fi so fu .  and gave them their exact Sounds as she composed them ; after which she  set up the following ;                      ac ec ic oc uc , ad ed i d od ud                      af ef if of uf , ag eg ig og ug .  And pronounced them likewise . She then sung the Cuzz 's Chorus ( which  may be found in the _ Little Pretty Play Thing _ , published by Mr.  NEWBERY ) and to the same Tune to which it is there set .  After this , Little _ Two - Shoes _ taught her to spell Words of one  Syllable , and she soon set up Pear , Plumb . Top , Ball , Pin , Puss , Dog ,  Hog , Fawn , Buck , Doe , Lamb , Sheep , Ram , Cow , Bull , Cock , Hen , and many  more .  The next Place we came to was _ Gaffer Cook 's _ Cottage ; there you  see it before you .  Here a number of poor Children were met to learn ; who all came round  Little _ Margery _ at once ; and , having pulled out her Letters , she  asked the little Boy next her , what he had for Dinner ? Who answered ,  _ Bread _ . ( the poor Children in many Places live very hard ) Well  then , says she , set the first Letter . He put up the Letter B , to which  the next added r , and the next e , the next a , the next d , and it stood  thus , _ Bread _ .  And what had you _ Polly Comb _ for your Dinner ? _ Apple - pye _  answered the little Girl : Upon which the next in Turn set up a great  A , the two next a p each , and so on till the two Words Apple and Pye  were united and stood thus , _ Apple - pye _ .  The next had _	1	0
 The next Place we came to was Farmer _ Thompson 's _ , where there  were a great many little ones waiting for her .  So little Mrs. _ Goody Two - Shoes _ , says one of them , where have  you been so long ? I have been teaching , says she , longer than I  intended , and am afraid I am come too soon for you now . No , but indeed  you are not , replied the other ; for I have got my Lesson , and so has  _ Sally Dawson _ , and so has _ Harry Wilson _ , and so we have  all ; and they capered about as if they were overjoyed to see her . Why  then , says she , you are all very good , and GOD Almighty will love you ;  so let us begin our Lessons . They all huddled round her , and though at  the other Place they were employed about Words and Syllables , here we  had People of much greater Understanding who dealt only in Sentences .  The Letters being brought upon the Table , one of the little ones set  up the following Sentence .  _ The Lord have Mercy upon me , and grant that I may be always good ,  and say my Prayers , and love the Lord my God with all my Heart , with  all my Soul , and with all my Strength ; and honour the King , and all  good Men in Authority under him . _  Then the next took the Letters , and composed this Sentence .  _ Lord have Mercy upon me , and grant that I may love my Neighbour as  myself , and do unto all Men as I would have them do unto me , and tell  no Lies ; but be honest and just in all my Dealings . _  The third composed the following Sentence .  _ The Lord have Mercy upon me , and grant that I may honour my Father  and Mother , and love my Brothers and Sisters , Relations and Friends ,  and all my Playmates , and every Body , and endeavour to make them  happy . _  The fourth composed the following .  _ I pray _ GOD _ to bless this whole Company , and all our Friends ,  and all our Enemies . _  To this last _ Polly Sullen _ objected , and said , truly , she did  not know why she should pray for her Enemies ? Not pray for your  Enemies , says Little _ Margery _ ; yes , you must , you are no  Christian , if you do n't forgive your Enemies , and do Good	1	0

Though ill ,  he began to joke with Little _ Margery _ , and said , laughingly , so ,  _ Goody Two - Shoes _ , they tell me you are a cunning little Baggage ;  pray , can you tell me what I shall do to get well ? Yes , Sir , says she ,  go to Bed when your Rooks do . You see they are going to Rest already :  Do you so likewise , and get up with them in the morning ; earn , as they  do , every Day what you eat , and eat and drink no more than you earn ;  and you 'll get Health and keep it . What should induce the Rooks to  frequent Gentlemens Houses only , but to tell them how to lead a  prudent Life ? They never build over Cottages or Farm - houses , because  they see , that these People know how to live without their Admonition .    _ Thus Health and Wit you may improve ,    Taught by the Tenants of the Grove . _  The Gentleman laughing gave _ Margery _ Sixpence ; and told her she  was a sensible Hussey .                                CHAP . VI .                _ How the whole Parish was frighted . _  Who does not know Lady _ Ducklington _ , or who does not know that  she was buried at this Parish Church ?  Well , I never saw so grand a Funeral in all my Life ; but the Money  they squandered away , would have been better laid out in little Books  for Children , or in Meat , Drink , and Cloaths for the Poor .  This if a fine Hearse indeed , and the nodding Plumes on the Horses  look very grand ; but what End does that answer , otherwise than to  display the Pride of the Living , or the Vanity of the Dead . Fie upon  such Folly , say I , and Heaven grant that those who want more Sense may  have it .  But all the Country round came to see the Burying , and it was late  before the Corpse was interred . After which , in the Night , or rather  about Four o'Clock in the Morning , the Bells were heard to jingle in  the Steeple , which frightened the People prodigiously , who all thought  it was Lady _ Ducklington _ 's Ghost dancing among the Bell - ropes .  The People flocked to _ Will Dobbins _ the Clerk , and wanted him to  go and see what it was ; but _ William _ said , he was sure it was a  Ghost , and that he would not offer to open the Door .

_ Dobbins _ too cried , and laying hold of her  Husband said , he should not be eat up by the Ghost . A Ghost , you  Blockheads , says Mr. _ Long _ in a Pet , did either of you ever see  a Ghost , or know any Body that did ? Yes , says the Clerk , my Father did  once in the Shape of a Windmill , and it walked all round the Church in  a white Sheet , with Jack Boots on , and had a Gun by its Side instead  of a Sword . A fine Picture of a Ghost truly , says Mr. _ Long _ ,  give me the Key of the Church , you Monkey ; for I tell you there is no  such Thing now , whatever may have been formerly.--Then taking the Key ,  he went to the Church , all the people following him . As soon as he had  opened the Door , what Sort of a Ghost do ye think appeared ? Why Little  _ Two - Shoes _ , who being weary , had fallen asleep in one of the  Pews during the Funeral Service , and was shut in all Night . She  immediately asked Mr. _ Long _ 's Pardon for the Trouble she had  given him , told him , she had been locked into the Church , and said ,  she should not have rung the Bells , but that she was very cold , and  hearing Farmer _ Boult _ 's Man go whistling by with his Horses , she  was in Hopes he would have went to the Clerk for the Key to let her  out .                                 CHAP . VII .                _ Containing an Account of all the Spirits ,                   or Ghosts , she saw in the Church . _  The People were ashamed to ask Little _ Madge _ any Questions  before Mr. _ Long _ , but as soon as he was gone , they all got round  her to satisfy their Curiousity , and desired she would give them a  particular Account of all that she had heard and seen .                                Her TALE .  I went to the Church , said she , as most of you did last Night , to see  the Burying , and being very weary , I sate me down in Mr.  _ Jones _ 's Pew , and fell fast asleep . At Eleven of the Clock I  awoke ; which I believe was in some measure occasioned by the Clock 's  striking , for I heard it . I started up , and could not at first tell  where I was ; but after some Time I recollected the Funeral , and soon  found that	1	0
As soon as I was on my Knees something very  cold , as cold as Marble , ay , as cold as Ice , touched my Neck , which  made me start ; however , I continued my Prayers , and having begged  Protection from Almighty GOD , I found my Spirits come , and I was  sensible that I had nothing to fear ; for GOD Almighty protects not  only all those who are good , but also all those who endeavour to be  good.--Nothing can withstand the Power , and exceed the Goodness of GOD  Almighty . Armed with the Confidence of his Protection , I walked down  the Church Isle , when I heard something , pit pat , pit pat , pit pat ,  come after me , and something touched my Hand , which seemed as cold as  a Marble Monument . I could not think what this was , yet I knew it  could not hurt me , and therefore I made myself easy , but being very  cold , and the Church being paved with Stone , which was very damp , I  felt my Way as well as I could to the Pulpit , in doing which something  brushed by me , and almost threw me down . However I was not frightened ,  for I knew , that GOD Almighty would suffer nothing to hurt me .  At last , I found out the Pulpit , and having shut too the Door , I laid  me down on the Mat and Cushion to sleep ; when something thrust and  pulled the Door , as I thought for Admittance , which prevented my going  to sleep . At last it cries , _ Bow , wow , wow _ ; and I concluded it  must be Mr. _ Saunderson _ 's Dog , which had followed me from their  House to Church , so I opened the Door , and called _ Snip , Snip _ ,  and the Dog jumped up upon me immediately . After this _ Snip _ and  I lay down together , and had a most comfortable Nap ; for when I awoke  again it was almost light . I then walked up and down all the Isles of  the Church to keep myself warm ; and though I went into the Vault , and  trod on Lady _ Ducklington 's _ Coffin , I saw no Ghost , and I  believe it was owing to the Reason Mr. _ Long _ has given you ,  namely , that there is no such Thing to be seen . As to my Part , I would  as soon lie all Night in the Church as in any other Place ; and I am  sure that any little Boy	1	0
                              REFLECTION .  After this , my dear Children , I hope you will not believe any foolish  Stories that ignorant , weak , or designing People may tell you about  _ Ghosts _ ; for the Tales of _ Ghosts _ , _ Witches _ , and _ Fairies _ , are the  Frolicks of a distempered Brain . No wise Man ever saw either of them .  Little _ Margery _ you see was not afraid ; no , she had _ good Sense _ ,  and a _ good Conscience _ , which is a Cure for all these imaginary  Evils .                               CHAP . VIII .            _ Of something which happened to Little _ Two - Shoes _          in a Barn , more dreadful than the Ghost in the Church ;      and how she returned Good for Evil to her Enemy Sir _ Timothy .  Some Days after this a more dreadful Accident befel Little _ Madge _ .  She happened to be coming late from teaching , when it rained ,  thundered , and lightened , and therefore she took Shelter in a Farmer 's  Barn at a Distance from the Village . Soon after , the Tempest drove in  four Thieves , who , not seeing such a little creep - mouse Girl as  _ Two - Shoes _ , lay down on the Hay next to her , and began to talk over  their Exploits , and to settle Plans for future Robberies . Little  _ Margery _ on hearing them , covered herself with Straw . To be sure she  was sadly frighted , but her good Sense taught her , that the only  Security she had was in keeping herself concealed ; therefore she laid  very still , and breathed very softly . About Four o'Clock these wicked  People came to a Resolution to break both Sir _ William Dove 's _ House ,  and Sir _ Timothy Gripe 's _ , and by Force of Arms to carry off all their  Money , Plate and Jewels ; but as it was thought then too late , they  agreed to defer it till the next Night . After laying this Scheme they  all set out upon their Pranks , which greatly rejoiced _ Margery _ , as it  would any other little Girl in her Situation . Early in the Morning she  went to Sir _ William _ , and told him the whole of their Conversation .  Upon which , he asked her Name , gave her Something , and bid her call at  his House the Day following . She also went to Sir _ Timothy _  notwithstanding standing he had used her so ill ; for she knew it was  her Duty to _ do Good	1	0
This Lady had more Sense than her Husband , which indeed is not a  singular Case ; for instead of despising Little _ Margery _ and her  Information , she privately set People to guard the House . The Robbers  divided themselves , and went about the Time mentioned to both Houses ,  and were surprized by the Guards , and taken . Upon examining these  Wretches , one of which turned Evidence , both Sir _ William _ and Sir  _ Timothy _ found that they owed their Lives to the Discovery made by  Little _ Margery _ , and the first took great Notice of her , and would no  longer let her lie in a Barn ; but Sir _ Timothy _ only said , that he was  ashamed to owe his Life to the Daughter of one who was his Enemy ; so  true it is , _ that a proud Man seldom forgives those he has injured _ .                                CHAP . IX .                      _ How Little _ Margery _ was made                     Principal of a Country College . _  Mrs. _ Williams _ , of whom I have given a particular Account in my _ New  Year 's Gift _ , and who kept a College for instructing little Gentlemen  and Ladies in the Science of A , B , C , was at this Time very old and  infirm , and wanted to decline that important Trust . This being told to  Sir _ William Dove _ , who lived in the Parish , he sent for Mrs.  _ Williams _ , and desired she would examine Little _ Two - Shoes _ , and see  whether she was qualified for the Office.----This was done , and Mrs.  _ Williams _ made the following Report in her Favour , namely , _ that  Little _ Margery _ was the best Scholar , and had the best Head , and the  best Heart of any one she had examined _ . All the Country had a great  Opinion of Mrs. _ Williams _ , and this Character gave them also a great  Opinion of Mrs. _ Margery _ ; for so we must now call her .  This Mrs. _ Margery _ thought the happiest Period of her Life ; but  more Happiness was in Store for her . GOD Almighty heaps up Blessings  for all those who love him , and though for a Time he may suffer them  to be poor and distressed , and hide his good Purposes from human  Sight , yet in the End they are generally crowned with Happiness  here , and no one can doubt of their being so hereafter .  On this Occasion the following Hymn , or rather a Translation of the  twenty -	1	0

When in the sultry Glebe I faint ,    Or on the thirsty Mountain pant ;    To fertile Vales and dewy Meads ,    My weary wand'ring Steps he leads ;    Where peaceful Rivers , soft and slow ,    Amid the verdant Landskip flow .    III .    Tho ' in the Paths of Death I tread ,    With gloomy Horrors overspread ,    My stedfast Heart shall fear no ill ,    For thou , O Lord , art with me still ;    Thy friendly Crook shall give me Aid ,    And guide me thro ' the dreadful Shade .

Tho ' in a bare and rugged Way ,    Thro ' devious lonely Wilds I stray ,    Thy Bounty shall my Pains beguile :    The barren Wilderness shall smile ,    With sudden Greens & herbage crown'd ,    And Streams shall murmur all around .  Here ends the History of Little _ Two Shoes _ . Those who would know  how she behaved after she came to be Mrs. _ Margery Two - Shoes _  must read the Second Part of this Work , in which an Account of the  Remainder of her Life , her Marriage , and Death are set forth at large ,  according to Act of Parliament .                           = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =                               The Renowned                                 HISTORY                                    OF                         Mrs. MARGERY TWO - SHOES .                           --------------------                                 PART II .                           --------------------                              INTRODUCTION .  In the first Part of this Work , the young Student has read , and I hope  with Pleasure and Improvement , the History of this Lady , while she was  known and distinguished by the Name of _ Little Two - Shoes _ ; we are  now come to a Period of her Life when that Name was discarded , and a  more eminent one bestowed upon her , I mean I mean that of Mrs.  _ Margery Two - Shoes _ : For as she was now President of the A , B , C  College , it became necessary to exalt her in Title as well as in  Place .  No sooner was she settled in this Office , but she laid every possible  Scheme to promote the Welfare and Happiness of all her Neighbours , and  especially of the Little Ones , in whom she took great Delight , and all  those whose Parents could not afford to pay for their Education , she  taught for nothing , but the Pleasure she had in their Company , for you  are to observe , that they were very good , or were soon made so by her  good Management	1	0
_  We have already informed the Reader , that the School where she taught ,  was that which was before kept by Mrs. _ Williams _ , whose  Character you may find in my _ New Year 's Gift _ . The Room was  large , and as she knew , that Nature intended Children should be always  in Action , she placed her different Letters , or Alphabets , all round  the School , so that every one was obliged to get up to fetch a Letter ,  or to spell a Word , when it came to their Turn ; which not only kept  them in Health , but fixed the Letters and Points firmly in their  Minds .  She had the following Assistants or Ushers to help her , and I will  tell you how she came by them . Mrs. _ Margery _ , you must know , was  very humane and compassionate ; and her Tenderness extended not only to  all Mankind , but even to all Animals that were not noxious ; as your 's  ought to do , if you would be happy here , and go to Heaven hereafter .  These are GOD Almighty 's Creatures as well as we . He made both them  and us ; and for wise Purposes , best known to himself , placed them in  this World to live among us ; so that they are our fellow Tenants of  the Globe . How then can People dare to torture and wantonly destroy  GOD Almighty 's Creatures ? They as well as you are capable of feeling  Pain , and of receiving Pleasure , and how can you , who want to be made  happy yourself , delight in making your fellow Creatures miserable ? Do  you think the poor Birds , whose Nest and young ones that wicked Boy  _ Dick Wilson _ ran away with Yesterday , do not feel as much Pain ,  as your Father and Mother would have felt , had any one pulled down  their House and ran away with you ? To be sure they do . Mrs.  _ Two - Shoes _ used to speak of those Things , and of naughty Boys  throwing at Cocks , torturing Flies , and whipping Horses and Dogs , with  Tears in her Eyes , and would never suffer any one to come to her  School who did so .  One Day , as she was going through the next Village , she met with some  wicked Boys who had got a young Raven , which they were going to throw  at , she wanted to get the poor Creature out of their cruel Hands , and  therefore gave them a Penny for him , and brought him	1	0
Do look at him and remember  what _ Solomon _ says , _ The Eye that despiseth his Father , and regardeth  not the Distress of his Mother , the Ravens of the Valley shall peck it  out , and the young Eagles eat it . _ Now this Bird she taught to speak ,  to spell and to read ; and as he was particularly fond of playing with  the large Letters , the Children used to call this _ Ralph_'a Alphabet .                        A B C D E F G H I J K L M                        N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z.  He always sat at her Elbow , as you see in the first Picture , and when  any of the Children were wrong , she used to call out , _ Put them  right Ralph _ , and a fine bird he is .   Do look at him .  Some Days after she had met with the Raven , as she was walking in the  Fields , she saw some naughty Boys , who had taken a Pidgeon , and tied a  String to its Leg , in order to let it fly , and draw it back again when  they pleased ; and by this Means they tortured the poor Animal with the  Hopes of Liberty and repeated Disappointment . This Pidgeon she also  bought , and taught him how to spell and read , though not to talk , and  he performed all those extraordinary Things which are recorded of the  famous Bird , that was some Time since advertised in the  _ Haymarket _ , and visited by most of the great People in the  Kingdom . This Pidgeon was a very pretty Fellow , and she called him  _ Tom _ . See here he is .  And as the Raven _ Ralph _ was fond of the large Letters ,  _ Tom _ the Pidgeon took Care of the small ones , of which he  composed this Alphabet .                        a b c d e f g h i j k l m                        n o p q r s t u v w x y z.  The Neighbours knowing that Mrs. _ Two Shoes _ was very good , as to  be sure nobody was better , made her a Present of a little Sky - lark ,  and a fine Bird he is .  Now as many People , even at that Time had learned to lie in Bed long  in the Morning , she thought the Lark might be of Use to her and her  Pupils , and tell them when to get up .  _ For be that is fond of his Bed , and lays ' till Noon	1	0
_  This Lamb she called _ Will _ , and a pretty Fellow he is ; do , look  at him .  No sooner was _ Tippy _ the Lark and _ Will _ the Ba - lamb  brought into the School , but that sensible Rogue _ Ralph _ , the  Raven , composed the following Verse , which every little good Boy and  Girl should get by Heart .    _ Early to Bed , and early to rise ;    Is the Way to be healthy , and wealthy , and wise _ .  A sly Rogue ; but it is true enough ; for those who do not go to Bed  early can not rise early ; and those who do not rise early can not do  much Business . Pray , let this be told at the Court , and to People who  have Routs and Rackets .  Soon after this , a Present was made to Mrs. _ Margery _ of little  Dog _ Jumper _ , and a pretty Dog he is . Pray , look at him .  _ Jumper , Jumper , Jumper ! _ He is always in a good Humour , and  playing and jumping about , and therefore he was called _ Jumper _ .  The Place assigned for _ Jumper _ was that of keeping the Door , so  that he may be called the Porter of the College , for he would let  nobody go out , or any one come in , without the Leave of his Mistress .  See how he sits , a saucy Rogue .  _ Billy _ the Ba - lamb was a chearful Fellow , and all the Children  were fond of him , wherefore Mrs. _ Two - Shoes _ made it a Rule , that  those who behaved best should have _ Will _ home with them at Night  to carry their Satchel or Basket at his Back , and bring it in the  Morning . See what a fine Fellow he is , and how he trudges along .                                CHAP . II .                _ A Scene of Distress ; in the School _ .  It happened one Day , when Mrs. _ Two - Shoes _ was diverting the  Children after Dinner , as she usually did with some innocent Games , or  entertaining and instructive Stories , that a Man arrived with the  melancholy News of _ Sally Jones 's _ Father being thrown from his  Horse , and thought past all Recovery ; nay , the Messenger said , that he  was seemingly dying , when he came away . Poor _ Sally _ was greatly  distressed , as indeed were all the School , for she dearly loved her  Father ,	1	0
All the  School were in Tears , and the Messenger was obliged to return ; but  before he went , Mrs. _ Two - Shoes _ , unknown to the Children ,  ordered _ Tom _ Pidgeon to go home with the Man , and bring a Letter  to inform her how Mr. _ Jones _ did . They set out together , and the  Pidgeon rode on the Man 's Head , ( as you see here ) for the Man was able  to carry the Pidgeon , though the Pidgeon was not able to carry the  Man , if he had , they would have been there much sooner , for _ Tom _  Pidgeon was _ very good _ , and never staid on an Errand .  Soon after the Man was gone the Pidgeon was lost , and the Concern the  Children were under for Mr. _ Jones _ and little _ Sally _ was  in some Measure diverted , and Part of their Attention turned after  _ Tom _ , who was a great Favourite , and consequently much bewailed .  Mrs. _ Margery _ , who knew the great Use and Necessity of teaching  Children to submit chearfully to the Will of Providence , bid them wipe  away their Tears , and then kissing _ Sally _ , you must be a good  Girl , says she , and depend upon GOD Almighty for his Blessing and  Protection ; for _ he is a Father to the Fatherless , and defendeth all  those who put their Trust in him _ . She then told them a Story ,  which I shall relate in as few Words as possible .              _ The History of Mr. _ Lovewell , _ Father                            to Lady _ Lucy .  Mr. _ Lovewell _ was born at _ Bath _ , and apprenticed to a  laborious Trade in _ London _ , which being too hard for him , he  parted with his Master by Consent , and hired himself as a common  Servant to a Merchant in the City . Here he spent his leisure Hours not  as Servants too frequently do , in Drinking and Schemes of Pleasure ,  but in improving his Mind ; and among other Acquirements , he made  himself a complete Master of Accompts . His Sobriety , Honesty , and the  Regard he paid to his Master 's Interest , greatly recommended him in  the whole Family , and he had several Offices of Trust committed to his  Charge , in which he acquitted himself so well , that the Merchant  removed him from the Stable into the Counting - house .  Here he soon made himself Master of the Business , and became so useful  to the Merchant	1	0
 After some Years the Merchant died , and left Mr. _ Lovewell _  possessed of many fine Ships at Sea , and much Money , and he was happy  in a Wife , who had brought him a Son and two Daughters , all dutiful  and obedient . The Treasures and good Things , however , of this Life are  so uncertain , that a Man can never be happy , unless he lays the  Foundation for it in his own Mind . So true is that Copy in our Writing  Books , which tells us , that _ a contented Mind is a continual  Feast _ .  After some Years successful Trade , he thought his Circumstances  sufficient to insure his own Ships , or , in other Words , to send his  Ships and Goods to Sea without being insured by others , as is  customary among Merchants ; when , unfortunately for him , four of them  richly laden were lost at Sea . This he supported with becoming  Resolution ; but the next Mail brought him Advice , that nine others  were taken by the _ French _ , with whom we were then at War ; and  this , together with the Failure of three foreign Merchants whom he had  trusted , compleated his Ruin . He was then obliged to call his  Creditors together , who took his Effects , and being angry with him for  the imprudent Step of not insuring his Ships , left him destitute of  all Subsistence . Nor did the Flatterers of his Fortune , those who had  lived by his Bounty when in his Prosperity , pay the least Regard  either to him or his Family . So true is another Copy , that you will  find in your Writing Book , which says , _ Misfortune tries our  Friends _ . All these Slights of his pretended Friends , and the ill  Usage of his Creditors , both he and his Family bore with Christian  Fortitude ; but other Calamities fell upon him , which he felt more  sensibly .  In his Distress , one of his Relations , who lived at _ Florence _ ,  offered to take his Son ; and another , who lived at _ Barbadoes _ ,  sent for one of his Daughters . The Ship which his Son sailed in was  cast away , and all the Crew supposed to be lost ; and the Ship , in  which his Daughter went a Passenger , was taken by Pyrates , and one  Post brought the miserable Father an Account of the Loss of his two  Children . This was the severest Stroke of all : It made him compleatly  wretched , and he knew it must	1	0
She found something was  labouring in his Breast , which was concealed from her ; and one Night  being disturbed in a Dream , with what was ever in his Thoughts , and  calling out upon his dear Children ; she awoke him , and insisted upon  knowing the Cause of his Inquietude . _ Nothing , my Dear , nothing , _  says he , _ The Lord gave , and the Lord hath taken away , blessed be  the Name of the Lord . _ This was sufficient to alarm the poor Woman ;  she lay till his Spirits were composed , and as she thought asleep ,  then stealing out of Bed , got the Keys and opened his Bureau , where  she found the fatal Account . In the Height of her Distractions , she  flew to her Daughter 's Room , and waking her with her Shrieks , put the  Letters into her Hands . The young Lady , unable to support this Load of  Misery , fell into a Fit , from which it was thought she never could  have been recovered . However , at last she revived ; but the Shock was  so great , that it entirely deprived her of her Speech .  Thus loaded with Misery , and unable to bear the Slights and Disdain of  those who had formerly professed themselves Friends , this unhappy Family  retired into a Country , where they were unknown , in order to hide  themselves from the World ; when , to support their Independency , the  Father laboured as well as he could at Husbandry , and the Mother and  Daughter sometimes got spinning and knitting Work , to help to furnish  the Means of Subsistence ; which however was so precarious and uncertain ,  that they often , for many Weeks together , lived on nothing but Cabbage  and Bread boiled in Water . But God never forsaketh the Righteous , nor  suffereth those to perish who put their Trust in him . At this Time a  Lady , who was just come to England , sent to take a pleasant Seat ready  furnished in that Neighbourhood , and the Person who was employed for the  Purpose , was ordered to deliver a Bank Note of an hundred Pounds to Mr.  _ Lovewell _ , another hundred to his Wife , and fifty to the Daughter ,  desiring them to take Possession of the House , and get it well aired  against she came down , which would be in two or three Days at most .  This , to People who were almost starving , was a sweet and seasonable  Relief , and they were all sollicitous to know their Benefactress , but of  that the Messenger	1	0
This was the agreeable Subject of their  Conversation till after Dinner , when drinking their Healths , she again  with Tears saluted them , and falling upon her Knees asked their  Blessings .  Tis impossible to express the mutual Joy which this occasioned . Their  Conversation was made up of the most endearing Expressions ,  intermingled with Tears and Caresses . Their Torrent of Joy , however ,  was for a Moment interrupted , by a Chariot which stopped at the Gate ,  and which brought as they thought a very unseasonable Visitor , and  therefore she sent to be excused from seeing Company .  But this had no Effect , for a Gentleman richly dressed jumped out of  the Chariot , and pursuing the Servant into the Parlour saluted them  round , who were all astonished at his Behaviour . But when the Tears  trickled from his Cheeks , the Daughter , who had been some Years dumb ,  immediately cried out , _ my Brother ! my Brother ! my Brother ! _ and  from that Instant recovered her Speech . The mutual Joy which this  occasioned , is better felt than expressed . Those who have proper  Sentiments of Humanity , Gratitude , and filial Piety will rejoice at  the Event , and those who have a proper Idea of the Goodness of God ,  and his gracious Providence , will from this , as well as other  Instances of his Goodness and Mercy , glorify his holy Name , and  magnify his Wisdom and Power , who is a Shield to the Righteous , and  defendeth all those who put their Trust in him .  As you , my dear Children , may be sollicitous to know how this happy  Event was brought about , I must inform you , that Mr. _ Lovewell _ 's Son ,  when the Ship foundered , had with some others got into the long Boat ,  and was taken up by a Ship at Sea , and carried to the East Indies ,  where in a little Time he made a large Fortune ; and the Pirates who  took his Daughter , attempted to rob her of her Chastity ; but finding  her Inflexible , and determined to die rather than to submit , some of  them behaved to her in a very cruel Manner ; but others , who had more  Honour and Generosity , became her Defenders ; upon which a Quarrel  arose between them , and the Captain , who was the worst of the Gang ,  being killed , the rest of the Crew carried the Ship into a Port of the  _ Manilla _ Islands , belonging to the _ Spaniards _ ; where , when her Story  was	1	0
Remember  _ Job _ , but I think you have not read so far , take the Bible ,  _ Billy Jones _ , and read the History of that good and patient Man .  At this Instant something was heard to slap at the Window , _ Wow ,  wow , wow _ , says Jumper , and attempted to leap up and open the Door ,  at which the Children were surprized ; but Mrs. _ Margery _ knowing  what it was , opened the Casement , as _ Noah _ did the Window of the  Ark , and drew in _ Tom _ Pidgeon with a Letter , and see here he is .  As soon as he was placed on the Table , he walked up to little  _ Sally _ , and dropping the Letter , cried , _ Co , Co , Coo _ , as  much as to say , _ there read it _ . Now this poor Pidgeon had  travelled fifty Miles in about an Hour , to bring _ Sally _ this  Letter , and who would destroy such pretty Creatures.--But let us read  the Letter .  _ My dear _ Sally ,  GOD Almighty has been very merciful , and restored your Pappa to us  again , who is now so well as to be able to sit up . I hear you are a  good Girl , my Dear , and I hope you will never forget to praise the  Lord for this his great Goodness and Mercy to us -- What a sad Thing it  would have been if your Father had died , and left both you and me , and  little _ Tommy _ in Distress , and without a Friend : Your Father  sends his Blessing with mine -- Be good , my dear Child , and God Almighty  will also bless you , whose Blessing is above all Things .  _ I am , my Dear Sally _ ,  _ Your ever affectionate Mother , _  MARTHA JONES .                                CHAP . III .                 _ Of the amazing Sagacity and Instincts                           of a little Dog _ .  Soon after this , a dreadful Accident happened in the School . It was on  a _ Thursday _ Morning , I very well remember , when the Children  having learned their Lessons soon , she had given them Leave to play ,  and they were all running about the School , and diverting themselves  with the Birds and the Lamb ; at this Time the Dog , all of a sudden ,  laid hold of his Mistress 's Apron , and endeavoured to pull her out of  the School . She was at first surprized , however , she followed him	1	0
 What a miraculous Deliverance was here ! How gracious ! How good was God  Almighty , to save all these Children from Destruction , and to make Use  of such an Instrument , as a little sagacious Animal to accomplish his  Divine Will . I should have observed , that as soon as they were all in  the Garden , the Dog came leaping round them to express his Joy , and  when the House was fallen , laid himself down quietly by his Mistress .  Some of the Neighbours , who saw the School fall , and who were in great  Pain for _ Margery _ and the little ones , soon spread the News  through the Village , and all the Parents , terrified for their  Children , came crowding in Abundance ; they had , however , the  Satisfaction to find them all safe , and upon their Knees , with their  Mistress , giving God thanks for their happy Deliverance .              ADVICE _ from the _ MAN _ in the _ MOON .  _ Jumper , Jumper , Jumper _ , what a pretty Dog he is , and how  sensible ? Had Mankind half the Sagacity of _ Jumper _ , they would  guard against Accidents of this Sort , by having a public Survey ,  occasionally made of all the Houses in every Parish ( especially of  those , which are old and decayed ) and not suffer them to remain in a  crazy State , ' till they fall down on the Heads of the poor  Inhabitants , and crush them to Death . Why , it was but Yesterday , that  a whole House fell down in _ Grace - church - street _ , and another in  _ Queen's - street _ , and an hundred more are to tumble , before this  Time twelve Months ; so Friends , take Care of yourselves , and tell the  Legislature , they ought to take Care for you . How can you be so  careless ? Most of your Evils arise from Carelesness and Extravagance ,  and yet you excuse yourselves , and lay the Fault upon Fortune . Fortune  is a Fool , and you are a Blockhead , if you put it in her Power to play  Tricks with you .  _ Yours _ ,  _ The _ MAN _ in the _ MOON .  You are not to wonder , my dear Reader , that this little Dog should  have more Sense than you , or your Father , or your Grandfather .  Though God Almighty has made Man the Lord of the Creation , and endowed  him with Reason , yet in many Respects , he has been altogether as  bountiful to other	1	0
You know this little Bird , _ sweet Jug , Jug , Jug _ ,  ' tis a Nightingale . This little Creature , after she has entertained us  with her Songs all the Spring , and bred up her little ones , flies into  a foreign Country , and finds her Way over the Great Sea , without any  of the Instruments and Helps which Men are obliged to make Use of for  that Purpose . Was you as wise as the Nightingale , you might make all  the Sailors happy , and have twenty thousand Pounds for teaching them  the Longitude .  You would not think _ Ralph _ the Raven half so wise and so good as he  is , though you see him here reading his book . Yet when the Prophet  _ Elijah _ , was obliged to fly from _ Ahab _ King of _ Israel _ , and hide  himself in a Cave , the Ravens , at the Command of God Almighty , fed him  every Day , and preserved his Life .  _ And the Word of the Lord came unto _ Elijah _ , saying , Hide  thyself by the Brook _ Cherith _ , that is before _ Jordan _ , and  I have commanded the Ravens to feed thee there . And the Ravens brought  him Bread and Flesh in the Morning , and Bread and Flesh in the  Evening , and he drank of the Brook , _ Kings , B.I.C. 17 .  And the pretty Pidgeon when the World was drowned , and he was confined  with _ Noah _ in the Ark , was sent forth by him to see whether the  Waters were abated , _ And he sent forth a Dove from him , to see if  the Waters were abated from off the Face of the Ground . And the Dove  came in to him in the Evening , and lo , in her Mouth was an Olive Leaf  plucked off : So _ Noah _ knew that the Waters were abated from off  the Earth . _ Gen. viii . 8 . 11 .  As these , and other Animals , are so sensible and kind to us , we ought  to be tender and good to them , and not beat them about , and kill them ,  and take away their young ones , as many wicked Boys do . Does not the  Horse and the Ass carry you and your burthens ; do n't the Ox plough  your Ground , the Cow give you Milk , the Sheep cloath your Back , the  Dog watch your House , the Goose find you in Quills to write with , the  Hen bring Eggs for your Custards and Puddings	1	0
 The downfal of the School , was a great Misfortune to Mrs.  _ Margery _ ; for she not only lost all her Books , but was destitute  of a Place to teach in ; but Sir William _ Dove _ , being informed of  this , ordered the House to be built at his own Expence , and ' till that  could be done , Farmer _ Grove _ was so kind , as to let her have his  large Hall to teach in .  The House built by Sir _ William _ , had a Statue erected over the  Door of a Boy sliding on the Ice , and under it were these Lines ,  written by Mrs. _ Two - Shoes _ , and engraved at her Expence .    On SIN . A SIMILE .      As a poor Urchin on the Ice ,    When he has tumbl'd once or twice ,    With cautious Step , and trembling goes ,    The drop - stile Pendant on his Nose ,    And trudges on to seek the Shore ,    Resolv'd to trust the Ice no more :    But meeting with a daring Mate ,    Who often us'd to slide and scate ,    Again is into Danger led ,    And falls again , and breaks his head .      So Youth when first they 're drawn to sin ,    And see the Danger they are in ,    Would gladly quit the thorney Way ,    And think it is unsafe to stay ;    But meeting with their wicked Train ,    Return with them to sin again :    With them the Paths of Vice explore ;    With them are ruin'd ever more .                                CHAP . IV .                   _ What happened at Farmer Grove 's ;                  and how she gratified him for the Use                             of his Room _ .  While at Mr. _ Grove 's _ , which was in the Heart of the Village ,  she not only taught the Children in the Day Time , but the Farmer 's  Servants , and all the Neighbours , to read and write in the Evening ;  and it was a constant Practice before they went away , to make them all  go to Prayers , and sing Psalms . By this Means , the People grew  extremely regular , his Servants were always at Home , instead of being  at the Ale - house , and he had more Work done than ever . This gave not  only Mr. _ Grove _ , but all the Neighbours , an high Opinion of her  good Sense and prudent Behaviour : And she was so much esteemed , that  most of the Differences in the Parish were left to her Decision ; and  if	1	0
These  were one Day brought by the Neighbours for _ Margery _ to talk to  them , when they fairly quarrelled before her , and were going to Blows ;  but she stepping between them , thus addressed the Husband ;  _ John _ , says she , you are a Man , and ought to have more Sense  than to fly in a Passion , at every Word that is said amiss by your  Wife ; and _ Martha _ , says she , you ought to know your Duty better ,  than to say any Thing to aggravate your Husband 's Resentment . These  frequent Quarrels , arise from the Indulgence of your violent Passions ;  for I know , you both love one another , notwithstanding what has passed  between you . Now , pray tell me _ John _ , and tell me _ Martha _ ,  when you have had a Quarrel the over Night , are you not both sorry for  it the next Day ? They both declared that they were : Why then , says  she , I 'll tell you how to prevent this for the future , if you will  both promise to take my Advice . They both promised her . You know , says  she , that a small Spark will set Fire to Tinder , and that Tinder  properly placed will fire a House ; an angry Word is with you as that  Spark , for you are both as touchy as Tinder , and very often make your  own House too hot to hold you . To prevent this , therefore , and to live  happily for the future , you must solemnly agree , that if one speaks an  angry Word , the other will not answer , ' till he or she has distinctly  called over all the Letters in the Alphabet , and the other not reply ,  ' till he has told twenty ; by this Means your Passions will be stifled ,  and Reason will have Time to take the Rule .  This is the best Recipe that was ever given for a married Couple to  live in Peace : Though _ John _ and his Wife frequently attempted to  quarrel afterwards , they never could get their Passions to any  considerable Height , for there was something so droll in thus carrying  on the Dispute , that before they got to the End of the Argument , they  saw the Absurdity of it , laughed , kissed , and were Friends .  Just as Mrs. _ Margery _ had settled this Difference between  _ John _ and his Wife , the Children ( who had been sent out to play ,  while that Business was transacting ) returned	1	0
You should  get up in the Morning , says she , and to conduct yourselves , as if that  Day was to be your last , and lie down at Night , as if you never  expected to see this World any more . This may be done , says she ,  without abating of your Chearfulness , for you are not to consider  Death as an Evil , but as a Convenience , as an useful Pilot , who is to  convey you to a Place of greater Happiness : Therefore , play my dear  Children , and be merry ; but be innocent and good . The good Man sets  Death at Defiance , for his Darts are only dreadful to the Wicked .  After this , she permitted the Children to bury the little Dormouse ,  and desired one of them to write his Epitaph , and here it is .  _ Epitaph on a _ DORMOUSE , _ really       written by a little _ BOY .    I.    In Paper Case ,    Hard by this Place ,  Dead a poor Dormouse lies ;    And soon or late ,    Summon'd by Fate ,  Each Prince , each Monarch dies .    II .

V.           _ The whole History of the Considering Cap , set forth          at large for the Benefit of all whom it may concern _ .  The great Reputation Mrs. _ Margery _ acquired by composing  Differences in Families , and especially , between Man and Wife , induced  her to cultivate that Part of her System of Morality and Economy , in  order to render it more extensively useful . For this Purpose , she  contrived what she called a Charm for the Passions ; which was a  considering Cap , almost as large as a Grenadier 's , but of three equal  Sides ; on the first of which was written , I MAY BE WRONG ; on the  second , IT IS FIFTY TO ONE BUT YOU ARE ; and on the third , I'LL  CONSIDER OF IT . The other Parts on the out - side , were filled with odd  Characters , as unintelligible as the Writings of the old  _ Egyptians _ ; but within Side there was a Direction for its Use ,  of the utmost Consequence ; for it strictly enjoined the Possessor to  put on the Cap , whenever he found his Passions begin to grow  turbulent , and not to deliver a Word whilst it was on , but with great 	1	0
They were bought by Husbands and  Wives , who had themselves frequent Occasion for them , and sometimes  lent them to their Children : They were also purchased in large  Quantities by Masters and Servants ; by young Folks , who were intent on  Matrimony , by Judges , Jurymen , and even Physicians and Divines ; nay ,  if we may believe History , the Legislators of the Land did not disdain  the Use of them ; and we are told , that when any important Debate  arose , _ Cap , was the Word _ , and each House looked like a grand  Synod of _ Egyptian _ Priests . Nor was this Cap of less Use to  Partners in Trade , for with these , as well as with Husband and Wife ,  if one was out of Humour , the other threw him the Cap , and he was  obliged to put it on , and keep it till all was quiet . I myself saw  thirteen Caps worn at a Time in one Family , which could not have  subsisted an Hour without them ; and I was particularly pleased at Sir  _ Humphry Huffum 's _ , to hear a little Girl , when her Father was  out of Humour , ask her Mamma , _ if she should reach down the Cap _ ?  These Caps , indeed , were of such Utility , that People of Sense never  went without them ; and it was common in the Country , when a Booby made  his Appearance , and talked Nonsense , to say , _ he had no Cap in his  Pocket _ .                     _ Advice from FRIAR BACON . _  What was _ Fortunatus _ 's Wishing Cap , when compared to this ? That  Cap , is said to have conveyed People instantly from one Place to  another ; but , as the Change of Place does not change the Temper and  Disposition of the Mind , little Benefit can be expected from it ; nor  indeed is much to be hoped from his famous Purse : That Purse , it is  said , was never empty , and such a Purse , may be sometimes convenient ;  but as Money will not purchase Peace , it is not necessary for a Man to  encumber himself with a great deal of it . Peace and Happiness depend  so much upon the State of a Man 's own Mind , and upon the Use of the  considering Cap , that it is generally his own Fault , if he is  miserable . One of these Caps will last a Man his whole Life , and is a  Discovery of much greater Importance to the Public than the  Philosopher	1	0
 _ Yours _ ROGER BACON .                                CHAP . VI .            _ How Mrs. _ MARGERY _ was taken up for a Witch ,                  and what happened on that Occasion . _  And so it is true ? And they have taken up Mrs. _ Margery _ then ,  and accused her of being a Witch , only because she was wiser than some  of her Neighbours ! Mercy upon me ! People stuff Children 's Heads with  Stories of Ghosts , Faries , Witches , and such Nonsense when they are  young , and so they continue Fools all their Days . The whole World  ought to be made acquainted with her Case , and here it is at their  Service .  _ The Case of Mrs. _ MARGERY .  Mrs. _ Margery _ , as we have frequently observed , was always doing  Good , and thought she could never sufficiently gratify those who had  done any Thing to serve her . These generous Sentiments , naturally led  her to consult the Interest of Mr. _ Grove _ , and the rest of her  Neighbours ; and as most of their Lands were Meadow , and they depended  much on their Hay , which had been for many Years greatly damaged by  wet Weather , she contrived an Instrument to direct them when to mow  their Grass with Safety , and prevent their Hay being spoiled . They all  came to her for Advice , and by that Means got in their Hay without  Damage , while most of that in the neighbouring Villages was spoiled .  This made a great Noise in the Country , and so provoked were the  People in the other Parishes , that they accused her of being a Witch ,  and sent Gasser _ Goosecap _ , a busy Fellow in other People 's  Concerns , to find out Evidence against her . This Wiseacre happened to  come to her School , when she was walking about with the Raven on one  Shoulder , the Pidgeon on the other , the Lark on her Hand , and the Lamb  and the Dog by her Side ; which indeed made a droll Figure , and so  surprized the that he cried out , a Witch ! a Witch ! upon this she  laughing , answered , a Conjurer ! a Conjurer ! and so they parted ; but it  did not end thus , for a Warrant was issued out against Mrs.  _ Margery _ , and she was carried to a Meeting of the Justices ,  whither all the Neighbours followed her .  At the Meeting , one of the Justices , who knew little of Life , and less  of the Law , behaved very idly	1	0
All the Company laughed , and Sir _ William  Dove _ , who was on the Bench , asked her Accusers , how they could be  such Fools , as to think there was any such Thing as a Witch . It is  true , continued he , many innocent and worthy People have been abused  and even murdered on this absurd and foolish Supposition ; which is a  Scandal to our Religion , to our Laws , to our Nation , and to common  Sense ; but I will tell you a Story .  There was in the West of _ England _ a poor industrious Woman , who  laboured under the same evil Report , which this good Woman is accused  of . Every Hog that died with the Murrain , every Cow that slipt her  Calf , she was accountable for : If a Horse had the Staggers , she was  supposed to be in his Head ; and whenever the Wind blew a little harder  than ordinary , _ Goody Giles _ was playing her Tricks , and riding  upon a Broomstick in the Air . These , and a thousand other Phantasies ,  too ridiculous to recite , possessed the Pates of the common People :  Horse - shoes were nailed with the Heels upwards , and many Tricks made  use of , to mortify the poor Creature ; and such was their Rage against  her , that they petitioned Mr. _ Williams _ , the Parson of the  Parish , not to let her come to Church ; and at last , even insisted upon  it : But this he over - ruled , and allowed the poor old Woman a Nook in  one of the Isles to herself , where she muttered over her Prayers in  the best Manner she could . The Parish , thus disconcerted and enraged ,  withdrew the small Pittance they allowed for her Support , and would  have reduced her to the Necessity of starving , had she not been still  assisted by the benevolent Mr. _ Williams _ .  But I hasten to the Sequel of my Story , in which you will find , that  the true Source from whence Witchcraft springs is _ Poverty _ ,  _ Age _ , and _ Ignorance _ ; and that it is impossible for a  Woman to pass for a Witch , unless she is _ very poor _ , _ very  old _ , and lives in a Neighbourhood where the People are _ void of  common Sense _ .  Some Time after , a Brother of her 's died in _ London _ , who , though he  would not part with a Farthing while he lived , at his Death was  obliged	1	0
 After this , Sir _ William _ inveighed against the absurd and  foolish Notions , which the Country People had imbibed concerning  Witches , and Witchcraft , and having proved that there was no such  Thing , but that all were the Effects of Folly and Ignorance , he gave  the Court such an Account of Mrs. _ Margery _ , and her Virtue , good  Sense , and prudent Behaviour , that the Gentlemen present were  enamoured with her , and returned her public Thanks for the great  Service she had done the Country . One Gentleman in particular , I mean  Sir _ Charles Jones _ , had conceived such an high Opinion of her ,  that he offered her a considerable Sum to take the Care of his Family ,  and the Education of his Daughter , which , however , she refused ; but  this Gentleman , sending for her afterwards when he had a dangerous Fit  of Illness , she went , and behaved so prudently in the Family , and so  tenderly to him and his Daughter , that he would not permit her to  leave his House , but soon after made her Proposals of Marriage . She  was truly sensible of the Honour he intended her , but , though poor ,  she would not consent to be made a Lady , till he had effectually  provided for his Daughter ; for she told him , that Power was a  dangerous Thing to be trusted with , and that a good Man or Woman would  never throw themselves into the Road of Temptation .  All Things being settled , and the Day fixed , the Neighbours came in  Crouds to see the Wedding ; for they were all glad , that one who had  been such a good little Girl , and was become such a virtuous and good  Woman , was going to be made a Lady ; but just as the Clergyman had  opened his Book , a Gentleman richly dressed ran into the Church , and  cry'd , Stop ! stop ! This greatly alarmed the Congregation , particularly  the intended Bride and Bridegroom , whom he first accosted , and desired  to speak with them apart . After they had been talking some little  Time , the People were greatly surprized to see Sir _ Charles _  stand Motionless , and his Bride cry , and faint away in the Stranger 's  Arms . This seeming Grief , however , was only a Prelude to a Flood of  Joy , which immediately succeeded ; for you must know , gentle Reader ,  that this Gentleman , so richly dressed and bedizened with Lace , was  that identical little Boy , whom you before saw	1	0
 There is something wonderful in this young Gentleman 's Preservation  and Success in Life ; which we shall acquaint the Reader of , in the  History of his Life and Adventures , which will soon be published .                           CHAP . VII . and Last .                      _ The true Use of Riches . _  The Harmony and Affection that subsisted between this happy Couple , is  inexpressible ; but Time , which dissolves the closest Union , after six  Years , severed Sir _ Charles _ from his Lady ; for being seized with  a violent Fever he died , and left her full of Grief , tho ' possessed of  a large Fortune .  We forgot to remark , that after her Marriage , _ Lady Jones _ ( for  so we must now call her ) ordered the Chappel to be fitted up , and  allowed the Chaplain a considerable Sum out of her own private Purse ,  to visit the Sick , and say Prayers every Day to all the People that  could attend . She also gave Mr. _ Johnson _ ten Guineas a Year , to  preach a Sermon , annually , on the Necessity and Duties of the marriage  State , and on the Decease of Sir _ Charles _ ; she gave him ten  more , to preach yearly on the Subject of Death ; she had put all the  Parish into Mourning for the Loss of her Husband ; and to those Men who  attended this yearly Service , she gave Harvest Gloves , to their Wives  Shoes and Stockings , and to all the Children little Books and  Plumb - cakes : We must also observe , that she herself wove a Chaplet of  Flowers , and before the Service , placed it on his Grave - stone ; and a  suitable Psalm was always sung by the Congregation .  About this Time , she heard that Mr. _ Smith _ was oppressed by Sir  Timothy Gripe _ , the Justice , and his Friend _ Graspall _ , who  endeavoured to deprive him of Part of his Tythes ; upon which she , in  Conjunction with her Brother , defended him , and the Cause was tried in  _ Westminster - hall _ , where Mr. _ Smith _ gained a Verdict ; and  it appearing that Sir _ Timothy _ had behaved most scandalously , as  a Justice of the Peace , he was struck off the List , and no longer  permitted to act in that Capacity . This was a Cut to a Man of his  imperious Disposition , and this was followed by one yet more severe ;  for a Relation of his , who had an undoubted Right to the  _	1	0
 At her first coming into Power , she took Care to gratify her old  Friends , especially Mr. and Mrs. _ Smith _ , whose Family she made  happy.--She paid great Regard to the Poor , made their Interest her  own , and to induce them to come regularly to Church , she ordered a  Loaf , or the Price of a Loaf , to be given to every one who would  accept of it . This brought many of them to Church , who by degrees  learned their Duty , and then came on a more noble Principle . She also  took Care to encourage Matrimony ; and in order to induce her Tenants  and Neighbours to enter into that happy State , she always gave the  young Couple something towards House - keeping ; and stood Godmother to  all their Children , whom she had in Parties , every _ Sunday _  Evening , to teach them their Catechism , and lecture them in Religion  and Morality ; after which she treated them with a Supper , gave them  such Books as they wanted , and then dispatched them with her Blessing .  Nor did she forget them at her Death , but left each a Legacy , as will  be seen among other charitable Donations when we publish her Will ,  which we may do in some future Volume . There is one Request however so  singular , that we can not help taking some Notice of it in this Place ;  which is , that of her giving so many Acres of Land to be planted  yearly with Potatoes , for all the Poor of any Parish who would come  and fetch them for the Use of their Families ; but if any took them to  sell they were deprived of that Privilege ever after . And these Roots  were planted and raised from the Rent arising from a Farm which she  had assigned over for that purpose . In short , she was a Mother to the  Poor , a Physician to the Sick , and a Friend to all who were in  Distress . Her Life was the greatest Blessing , and her Death the  greatest Calamity that ever was felt in the Neighbourhood . A Monument ,  but without Inscription , was erected to her Memory in the Church - yard ,  over which the Poor as they pass weep continually , so that the Stone  is ever bathed in Tears .  On this Occasion the following Lines were spoken extempore by a young  Gentleman .    _ How vain the Tears that fall from you ,    And here supply the Place of Dew ?    How vain to weep the happy Dead ,    Who now to heavenly Realms	1	0
"To suppress this Turbulence of Mind ,  which was a Symptom of approaching Avarice , she said her Prayers earlier  than usual , and at Night had the following Dream ; which I shall relate  in her own Words .  "" Methought , as I slept , a Genii stept up to me with a _ French _  Commode , which having placed on my Head , he said , now go and be happy ;  for from henceforth every Thing you touch shall turn to Gold . Willing  to try the Experiment , I gently touched the Bed - post and Furniture ,  which immediately became massy Gold burnished , and of surprizing  Brightness . I then touched the Walls of the House , which assumed the  same Appearance , and looked amazingly magnificent . Elated with this  wonderful Gift , I rang hastily for my Maid to carry the joyful News to  her Master , who , as I thought , was then walking in the Garden .  _ Sukey _ came , but in the Extacy I was in , happening to touch her  Hand , she became instantly an immovable Statue . Go , said I , and call  your Master ; but she made no reply , nor could she stir . Upon this I  shrieked , and in came my dear Husband , whom I ran to embrace ; when no  sooner had I touched him , but he became good for nothing ; that is ,  good for nothing but his Weight in Gold ; and that you know could be  nothing , where Gold was so plenty . At this instant up came another  Servant with a Glass of Water , thinking me ill ; this I attempted to  swallow , but no sooner did it touch my Mouth , than it became a hard  solid Body , and unfit for drinking . My Distress now grew  insupportable ! I had destroyed , as I thought , my dear Husband , and my  favourite Servant ; and I plainly perceived , that I should die for want  in the midst of so much Wealth . Ah , said I , why did I long for Riches !  Having enough already , why did I covet more ? Thus terrified , I began  to rave , and beat my Breast , which awaked Sir _ Charles _ , who  kindly called me from this State of Inquietude , and composed my Mind . ""  This Scene I have often considered as a Lesson , instructing me , that a  Load of Riches bring , instead of Felicity , a Load of Troubles ; and  that the only Source of Happiness is _ Contentment _ . Go ,  therefore , you who"	1	0
 _ An Anecdote , respecting _ TOM TWO - SHOES , _ communicated by a  Gentleman , who is now writing the History of his Life . _  It is generally known , that _ Tom Two - Shoes _ went to Sea when he was  a very little Boy , and very poor ; and that he returned a very great Man ,  and very rich ; but no one knows how he acquired so much Wealth but  myself , and a few Friends , who have perused the Papers from which I am  compiling the History of his Life .  After _ Tom _ had been at Sea some Years , he was unfortunately cast  away , on that Part of the Coast of _ Africa _ inhabited by the  _ Hottentots _ . Here he met with a strange Book , which the  _ Hottentots _ did not understand , and which gave him some Account  of _ Prester John 's _ Country ; and being a Lad of great Curiosity  and Resolution he determined to see it ; accordingly he set out on the  Pursuit , attended by a young Lion , which he had tamed and made so fond  of him , that he followed him like a Dog , and obeyed all his Commands ;  and indeed it was happy for him that he had such a Companion ; for as  his Road lay through large Woods and Forests , that were full of wild  Beasts and without Inhabitants , he must have been soon starved or torn  in Pieces , had he not been both fed and protected by this noble  Animal .  _ Tom _ had provided himself with two Guns , a Sword , and as much  Powder and Ball as he could carry ; with these Arms , and such a  Companion , it was mighty easy for him to get Food ; for the Animals in  these wild and extensive Forests , having never seen the Effects of a  Gun , readily ran from the Lion , who hunted on one Side , to _ Tom _ ,  who hunted on the other , so that they were either caught by the Lion ,  or shot by his Master ; and it was pleasant enough , after a hunting  Match , and the Meat was dressed , to see how Cheek by Joul they sat  down to Dinner .  When they came info the Land of _ Utopia _ , he discovered the  Statue of a Man created on an open Plain , which had this Inscription  on the Pedestal : _ On _ May - day _ in the Morning , when the Sun  rises , I shall have a Head of Gold _ .	1	0
 _ Tom _ got up very early on the first of _ May _ to behold this  amazing Change , and when he came near the Statue he saw a Number of  People , who all ran away from him in the utmost Consternation , hating  never before seen a Lion follow a Man like a Lap - dog . Being thus left  alone , he fixed his Eyes on the Sun , then rising with resplendent  Majesty , and afterwards turned to the Statue , but could see no Change  in the Stone.--Surely , says he to himself , there is some mystical  Meaning in this ! This Inscription must be an √Ünigma , the hidden  Meaning of which I will endeavour to find ; for a Philosopher would  never expect a Stone to be turned to Gold ; accordingly he measured the  Length of the Shadow , which the Statue gave on the Ground by the Sun  shining on it , and marked that particular Part where the Head fell ,  then getting a _ Chopness _ ( a Thing like a Spade ) and digging , he  discovered a Copper - chest , full of Gold , with this Inscription  engraved on the Lid of it .                                 Thy WIT ,                        Oh Man ! whoever thou art ,                        Hath disclos'd the √Ünigma ,                     And discover'd the GOLDEN HEAD .

Remember                        The unprofitable Servant ,                    Who hid his _ Talent _ in a Napkin ;                                   And                           The profligate Son ,                  Who squander'd away his Substance and                           fed with the Swine .                    As thou hast got the GOLDEN HEAD ,                        Observe the _ Golden Mean _ ,                         Be _ Good _ and be happy .  This Lesson , coming as it were from the Dead , struck him with such  Awe , and Reverence for Piety and Virtue , that , before he removed the  Treasure , he kneeled down , and earnestly and fervently prayed that he  might make a prudent , just and proper Use of it . He then conveyed the  Chest away ; but how he got it to _ England _ , the Reader will be  informed in the History of his Life . It may not be improper , however ,  in this Place , to give the Reader some Account of the Philosopher who  hid this Treasure , and took so much Pains to find a true and	1	0
 That he had acquired a Fortune by Commerce , and having no Relations to  leave it to , he travelled through _ Arabia , Persia , India , Libia _  and _ Utopia _ in search of a real Friend . In this Pursuit he found  several with whom he exchanged good Offices , and that were polite and  obliging , but they often flew off for Trifles ; or as soon as he  pretended to be in Distress , and requested their Assistance , left him  to struggle with his own Difficulties . So true is that Copy in our  Books , which says , _ Adversity is the Touchstone of Friendship _ .  At last , however , he met with the _ Utopian _ Philosopher , or the  wise Man of the Mountain , as he is called , and thought in him he had  found the Friend he wanted ; for though he often pretended to be in  Distress , and abandoned to the Frowns of Fortune , this Man always  relieved him , and with such Chearfulness and Sincerity , that  concluding he had found out the only Man to whom he ought to open both  his Purse and his Heart , he let him so far into his Secrets , as to  desire his Assistance in hiding a large Sum of Money , which he wanted  to conceal , lest the Prince of the Country , who was absolute , should ,  by the Advice of his wicked Minister , put him to Death for his Gold .  The two Philosophers met and hid the Money , which the Stranger , after  some Days , went to see , but found it gone . How was he struck to the  Heart , when he found that his Friend , whom he had often tried , and who  had relieved him in his Distress , could not withstand this Temptation ,  but broke through the sacred Bonds of Friendship , and turned even a  Thief for Gold which he did not want , as he was already very rich . Oh !  said he , what is the Heart of Man made of ? Why am I condemned to live  among People who have no Sincerity , and who barter the most sacred  Ties of Friendship and Humanity for the Dirt that we tread on ? Had I  lost my Gold and found a real Friend , I should have been happy with  the Exchange , but now I am most miserable . After some Time he wiped  off his Tears , and being determined not to be so imposed on , he had  Recourse to Cunning and the Arts of Life . He went to his pretended  Friend with a chearful Countenance	1	0
Our Philosopher immediately  took the Gold , and putting it into his Pocket , told the other he had  now altered his Mind , and should bury it no more , till he found a Man  more worthy of his Confidence . See what People lose by being  dishonest . This calls to my Mind the Words of the Poet :   _ A Wit 's a Feather , and a Chief 's a Rod ,    An honest Man 's the noblest Work of God . _  Remember this Story , and take Care whom you trust ; but do n't be  covetous , sordid and miserable ; for the Gold we have is but lent us to  do Good with . We received all from the Hand of God , and every Person  in Distress hath a just Title to a Portion of it .                 _ A _ LETTER _ from the _ PRINTER , _ which he                        desires may be inserted _ .  SIR ,  I have done with your Copy , so you may return it to the  _ Vatican _ , if you please ; and pray tell Mr. _ Angelo _ to  brush up the Cuts , that , in the next Edition , they may give us a good  Impression .  The Foresight and Sagacity of Mrs. _ Margery _ 's Dog calls to my  Mind a Circumstance , which happened when I was a Boy . Some Gentlemen  in the Place where I lived had been hunting , and were got under a  great Tree to shelter themselves from a Thunder Storm ; when a Dog that  always followed one of the Gentlemen leaped up his Horse several  Times , and then ran away and barked . At last , the Gentlemen all  followed to see what he would be at ; and they were no sooner gone from  the Tree , but it was shivered in Pieces by Lightning ! ' Tis remarkable ,  that as soon as they came from the Tree the Dog appeared to be very  well satisfied , and barked no more . The Gentleman after this always  regarded the Dog as his Friend , treated him in his Old Age with great  Tenderness , and fed him with Milk as long as he lived .  My old Master _ Grierson _ had also a Dog , that ought to be  mentioned with Regard ; for he used to set him up as a Pattern of  Sagacity and Prudence , not only to his Journeymen , but to the whole  Neighbours . This Dog had been taught a thousand Tricks , and among  other Feats he could dance , tumble , and drink Wine and Punch till he  was little better than mad .	1	0
"These stories , never heard outside the haunts of  the lumberjack until recent years , are now being collected by learned  educators and literary authorities who declare that Paul Bunyan is "" the  only American myth . ""  The best authorities never recounted Paul Bunyan 's exploits in narrative  form . They made their statements more impressive by dropping them  casually , in an off hand way , as if in reference to actual events of  common knowledge . To over awe the greenhorn in the bunkshanty , or the  paper - collar stiffs and home guards in the saloons , a group of  lumberjacks would remember meeting each other in the camps of Paul  Bunyan . With painful accuracy they established the exact time and place ,  "" on the Big Onion the winter of the blue snow "" or "" at Shot Gunderson 's  camp on the Tadpole the year of the sourdough drive . "" They elaborated on  the old themes and new stories were born in lying contests where the  heights of extemporaneous invention were reached .  In these conversations the lumberjack often took on the mannerisms of  the French Canadian . This was apparently done without special intent and  no reason for it can be given except for a similarity in the mock  seriousness of their statements and the anti - climax of the bulls that  were made , with the braggadocio of the _ habitant _ . Some investigators  trace the origin of Paul Bunyan to Eastern Canada . Who can say ?         *        *        *        *        *  PAUL Bunyan came to Westwood , California in 1913 at the suggestion of  some of the most prominent loggers and lumbermen in the country . When  the Red River Lumber Company announced their plans for opening up their  forests of Sugar Pine and California White Pine , friendly advisors shook  their heads and said ,    "" Better send for Paul Bunyan . ""  Apparently here was the job for a  Superman,--quality - and - quantity - production on a big scale and great  engineering difficulties to be overcome . Why not Paul Bunyan ? This is a  White Pine job and here in the High Sierras the winter snows lie deep ,  just like the country where Paul grew up . Here are trees that dwarf the  largest "" cork pine "" of the Lake States and many new stunts were planned  for logging , milling and manufacturing a product of supreme  quality -- just the job for Paul Bunyan .  The Red River people had been cutting White Pine in Minnesota for two  generations ; the crews that came west with them were old heads and every  one knew Paul Bunyan of old"	1	0
" It stands for the quality and service you have the right to expect from  Paul Bunyan .         *        *        *        *        *  WHEN and where did this mythical hero get his start ? Paul Bunyan is  known by his mighty works ; his antecedents and personal history are lost  in doubt . You can prove that Paul logged off North Dakota and grubbed  the stumps , not only by the fact that there are no traces of pine  forests in that State , but by the testimony of oldtimers who saw it  done . On the other hand , Paul 's parentage and birth date are unknown .  Like Topsy , he jes ' growed .  Nobody cared to know his origin until the professors got after him . As  long as he stayed around the camps his previous history was treated with  the customary consideration and he was asked no questions , but when he  broke into college it was all off . Then he had to have ancestors , a  birthday and all sorts of vital statistics . For now Paul is recognized  as a regular Myth and students of folk - lore are making scientific  research of the Paul Bunyan Legend .  R. R. Fenska , Professor of Forest Engineering , New York State College of  Forestry , Syracuse University , an authority on Paul Bunyan , writes : "" He  is not only an all - American myth but as far as can be determined , the  only myth or legend in this country . It is all - American because Paul 's  exploits are all accomplished on this continent and there is no  counterpart in the Old World . The origin of Paul is as much a myth as  the legend itself . There are some who feel that he was known in the  Northeastern forest back in the early 19th century but the best  available evidence points to the pineries of the Lake States as the  "" Mother "" of Paul Bunyan . It is certain that he developed to the zenith  of his powers in that region during the ' 80s and ' 90s . ""  Professor Fenska points out that Paul was a "" Northerner "" for when the  virgin forests of the Lake States began to wane and the lumberjack  shifted to the Southern Yellow Pine region , little was heard of him for  nearly a decade . Noting his reappearance on the Pacific Coast , this  authority discounts the rumors that Paul has gone to Alaska and  expresses the opinion that his greatest exploits will take place in the  vast forests of the west .  Esther Shepherd , Department of English , Reed College , Portland , Oregon  has"	1	0
" "" Paul Bunyan was born in Maine . When three weeks old he rolled around so  much in his sleep that he destroyed four square miles of standing  timber . Then they built a floating cradle for him and anchored it off  Eastport . When Paul rocked in his cradle it caused a seventy - five foot  tide in the Bay of Fundy and several villages were washed away . He  could n't be wakened , however , until the British Navy was called out and  fired broadsides for seven hours . When Paul stepped out of his cradle he  sank seven warships and the British government seized his cradle and  used the timber to build seven more . That saved Nova Scotia from  becoming an island , but the tides in the Bay of Fundy have n't subsided  yet . ""  "" Seeing that this North American Continent has only one myth that is  entirely it 's own "" J. M. Leever of the Pacific Lumber Company writes in  a San Francisco paper , "" It is a pity that it should have been in danger  of being forgotten . "" After paying tribute to the work of Prof. Fenska  and the University of Oregon Mr. Leever continues , "" Where the tradition  of this Davy Crockett of the axe , this superman of the camps originated ,  nobody can tell exactly . But it is probable that the stories of his  courage and impossible feats started on the St. Lawrence among the  French Canadians and filtered into the woods of the Adirondacks ,  Michigan and Wisconsin . Although at times very human , Paul Bunyan in his  bigger moments far surpassed any of the figures of classical  Scandinavian or Celtic legend . For the sake of the young of the land his  memory ought to be kept forever fresh . ""  Lee J. Smits conducted a "" Paul Bunyan "" column in _ The Seattle Star _ and  published many entertaining contributions from oldtimers . These were  turned over to the University of Washington for preservation .  "" Standing alone in his might and inventiveness is Paul Bunyan , central  figure in America 's meager folklore "" Mr. Smits says editorially , "" Only  among the pioneers could Paul thrive , his deeds are inspired by such  imagination as grows only in the great outdoors . For hours at a time ,  lumberjacks will pile up the achievements of their hero . Each story is a  challenge calling for a yarn still more heroic . The story teller who  succeeds in eliciting a snicker is an artist , indeed , as the Paul Bunyan  legends must always be related and received with perfect seriousness .

"  Mr. Harry L. Neall , of Harry L. Neall & Son , Mining Engineers of Eureka ,  Cal . , a student of the history of the lumber industry , has written that  beneath the phrase  invented lumbering "" used in connection with Paul  Bunyan , there exists a basis of fact . Tracing the beginnings of the  industry from the cutting of "" The King 's Spars "" in what is now the State  of Maine , before the Mayflower came to Plymouth Rock , Mr. Neall states  that "" modern lumbering , as a separate industry was really invented in  New York in 1790 and that most of the oldtime lumbermen trace their  ancestry to forefathers who were a part of this beginning of lumbering . ""  The Red River people were interested to learn from Mr. Neall that a  Walker built a mill in Maine in 1680 ; another Walker sold a two - thirds  interest in this mill in 1716 and three Walkers were saw mill owners in  New Hampshire in 1785 . Following the Pine Cutters across New York and  Pennsylvania , Mr. Neall found that the land records enable one to pick  them out by their names "" as distinguished from the Palatinate settlers  who came solely for the farm lands upon which the hardwoods grew . "" That  the Paul Bunyan stories go back to the beginnings of the industry is the  belief of Mr. Neall who heard them in his grandfather 's logging camps in  Pennsylvania and quotes this ancestor as connecting Paul with the early  traditions .  DeWitt L. Hardy , "" column conductor "" on the Portland _ Oregonian _ , ran a  Paul Bunyan series for several months and received many more  contributions than it was possible to print , though they were featured  almost daily , writes Mr. Hardy :  "" Paul Bunyan is , as your folklore sharks doubtless will inform you ,  about the only true fable of this character we have in this country . I  do not attempt to dip into any of the real sub - surface studies of its  development , my experience with Paul having been severely practical . I  first heard of him in a soddy in North Dakota , where I was told of his  great logging operations when he stripped that country and removed the  stumps . In the mass of correspondence I received while handling the Paul  Bunyan yarns here , answers came from all corners of the globe and from  all classes of people . ""  Ida V. Turney , Department of Rhetoric , University of Oregon , and  President of the Oregon Council of English , has written a chapbook of  Paul Bunyan stories,--""gang - lore """	1	0
"The symbolism is , of course ,  unconscious , but none the less accurate . ""  Miss Turney , the daughter of a lumberman , has known these stories from  childhood . "" All Paul Bunyan stories start in a gang "" she says , "" others  are imitations ... Perhaps Paul Bunyan is the great American epic ; but  if so it is _ in the making _ . In that case it seems to me that any gang  has a perfect right to create new stories .... Paul has become  astonishingly versatile in the West . He has tried his hand at almost  everything , just as the former laborers in the camps of Michigan and  Wisconsin branched into whatever big wild untamed hard work they came  across . ""         *        *        *        *        *  BABE , the big blue ox , constituted Paul Bunyan 's assets and liabilities .  History disagrees as to when , where and how Paul first acquired this  bovine locomotive but his subsequent record is reliably established .  Babe could pull anything that had two ends to it .  Babe was seven axehandles wide between the eyes according to some  authorities ; others equally dependable say forty - two axehandles and a  plug of tobacco . Like other historical contradictions this comes from  using different standards . Seven of Paul 's axehandles were equal to a  little more than forty - two of the ordinary kind .  When cost sheets were figured on Babe , Johnny Inkslinger found that  upkeep and overhead were expensive but the charges for operation and  depreciation were low and the efficiency was very high . How else could  Paul have hauled logs to the landing a whole section ( 640 acres ) at a  time ? He also used Babe to pull the kinks out of the crooked logging  roads and it was on a job of this kind that Babe pulled a chain of  three - inch links out into a straight bar .  They could never keep Babe more than one night at a camp for he would  eat in one day all the feed one crew could tote to camp in a year . For a  snack between meals he would eat fifty bales of hay , wire and all and  six men with picaroons were kept busy picking the wire out of his teeth .  Babe was a great pet and very docile as a general thing but he seemed to  have a sense of humor and frequently got into mischief . He would sneak  up behind a drive and drink all the water out of the river , leaving the  logs high and dry . It was impossible to build an ox - sling"	1	0
"His tracks were so far apart that it was  impossible to follow him and so deep that a man falling into one could  only be hauled out with difficulty and a long rope . Once a settler and  his wife and baby fell into one of these tracks and the son got out when  he was fifty - seven years old and reported the accident . These tracks ,  today form the thousands of lakes in the "" Land of the Sky - Blue Water . ""         *        *        *        *        *  BECAUSE he was so much younger than Babe and was brought to camp when a  small calf , Benny was always called the Little Blue Ox although he was  quite a chunk of an animal . Benny could not , or rather , would not haul  as much as Babe nor was he as tractable but he could eat more .  Paul got Benny for nothing from a farmer near Bangor , Maine . There was  not enough milk for the little fellow so he had to be weaned when three  days old . The farmer only had forty acres of hay and by the time Benny  was a week old he had to dispose of him for lack of food . The calf was  undernourished and only weighed two tons when Paul got him . Paul drove  from Bangor out to his headquarters camp near Devil 's Lake , North Dakota  that night and led Benny behind the sleigh . Western air agreed with the  little calf and every time Paul looked back at him he was two feet  taller .  When they arrived at camp Benny was given a good feed of buffalo milk  and flapjacks and put into a barn by himself . Next morning the barn was  gone . Later it was discovered on Benny 's back as he scampered over the  clearings . He had outgrown his barn in one night .  Benny was very notional and would never pull a load unless there was  snow on the ground so after the spring thaws they had to white wash the  logging roads to fool him .  Gluttony killed Benny . He had a mania for pancakes and one cook crew of  two hundred men was kept busy making cakes for him . One night he pawed  and bellowed and threshed his tail about till the wind of it blew down  what pine Paul had left standing in Dakota . At breakfast time he broke  loose , tore down the cook shanty and began bolting pancakes . In his  greed he swallowed the red - hot stove . Indigestion set in and nothing  could save him . What disposition was made of his body is a matter"	1	0
"He thinks  they have several carloads of it left .  Another authority states that the body of Benny was dragged to a safe  distance from the North Dakota camp and buried . When the earth was  shoveled back it made a mound that formed the Black Hills in South  Dakota .         *        *        *        *        *  THE custodian and chaperon of Babe the Big Blue Ox was Brimstone Bill .  He knew all the tricks of that frisky giant before they happened .  "" I know oxen "" the old bullwhacker used to say , "" I 've worked 'em and fed  'em and doctored 'em ever since the ox was invented . And Babe , I know  that pernicious old reptyle same as if I 'd abeen through him with a  lantern . ""  Bill compiled "" The Skinner 's Dictionary "" , a hand book for teamsters , and  most of the terms used in directing draft animals ( except mules )  originated with him . His early religious training accounts for the fact  that the technical language of the teamster contains so many names of  places and people spoken of in the Bible .  The buckskin harness used on Babe and Benny when the weather was rainy  was made by Brimstone Bill . When this harness got wet it would stretch  so much that the oxen could travel clear to the landing and the load  would not move from the skidway in the woods . Brimstone would fasten the  harness with an anchor Big Ole made for him and when the sun came out  and the harness shrunk the load would be pulled to the landing while  Bill and the oxen were busy at some other job .  The winter of the Blue Snow , the Pacific Ocean froze over and Bill kept  the oxen busy hauling regular white snow over from China . M. H. Keenan  can testify to the truth of this as he worked for Paul on the Big Onion  that winter . It must have been about this time that Bill made the first  ox yokes out of cranberry wood .         *        *        *        *        *  FEEDING Paul Bunyan 's crews was a complicated job . At no two camps were  conditions the same . The winter he logged off North Dakota he had 300  cooks making pancakes for the Seven Axemen and the little Chore - boy . At  headquarters on the Big Onion he had one cook and 462 cookees feeding a  crew so big that Paul himself never knew within several hundred either  way , how many men he had .  At Big Onion camp there was a lot of mechanical equipment and the "	1	0
 Cooks came and went . Some were good and others just able to get by . Paul  never kept a poor one , very long . There was one jigger who seemed to  have learned to do nothing but boil . He made soup out of everything and  did most of his work with a dipper . When the big tote - sled broke through  the ice on Bull Frog Lake with a load of split peas , he served warmed up  lake water till the crew struck . His idea of a lunch box was a jug or a  rope to freeze soup onto like a candle . Some cooks used too much grease .  It was said of one of these that he had to wear calked shoes to keep  from sliding out of the cook - shanty and rub sand on his hands when he  picked anything up .  There are two kinds of camp cooks , the Baking Powder Bums and the  Sourdough Stiffs . Sourdough Sam belonged to the latter school . He made  everything but coffee out of Sourdough . He had only one arm and one leg ,  the other members having been lost when his sourdough barrel blew up .  Sam officiated at Tadpole River headquarters , the winter Shot Gunderson  took charge .  After all others had failed at Big Onion camp , Paul hired his cousin Big  Joe who came from three weeks below Quebec . This boy sure put a mean  scald on the chuck . He was the only man who could make pancakes fast  enough to feed the crew . He had Big Ole , the blacksmith make him a  griddle that was so big you could n't see across it when the steam was  thick . The batter , stirred in drums like concrete mixers , was poured on  with cranes and spouts . The griddle was greased by colored boys who  skated over the surface with hams tied to their feet . They had to have  colored boys to stand the heat .  At this camp the flunkeys wore roller skates and an idea of the size of  the tables is gained from the fact that they distributed the pepper with  four - horse teams .  Sending out lunch and timing the meals was rendered difficult by the  size of the works which required three crews -- one going to work , one on  the job and one coming back . Joe had to start the bull - cook out with the  lunch sled two weeks ahead of dinner time . To call the men who came in  at noon was another problem . Big Ole made a dinner horn so big that no  one could blow it but Big Joe	1	0
"The Red River people would n't stand  for that so the next time he blew straight up but this caused severe  cyclones and storms at sea so Paul had to junk the horn and ship it East  where later it was made into a tin roof for a big Union Depot .  The only active Volcano in America . Where Big Joe cooks the beans . _ ]  When Big Joe came to Westwood with Paul , he started something . About  that time you may have read in the papers about a volcanic eruption at  Mt. Lassen , heretofore extinct for many years . That was where Big Joe  dug his bean - hole and when the steam worked out of the bean kettle and  up through the ground , everyone thought the old hill had turned volcano .  Every time Joe drops a biscuit they talk of earthquakes .  It was always thought that the quality of the food at Paul 's Camps had a  lot to do with the strength and endurance of the men . No doubt it did ,  but they were a husky lot to start with . As the feller said about fish  for a brain food , "" It wo n't do you no good unless there is a germ there  to start with . ""  There must have been something to the food theory for the chipmunks that  ate the prune pits got so big they killed all the wolves and years later  the settlers shot them for tigers .  A visitor at one of Paul 's camps was astonished to see a crew of men  unloading four - horse logging sleds at the cook shanty . They appeared to  be rolling logs into a trap door from which poured clouds of steam .  "" That 's a heck of a place to land logs "" he remarked .  "" Them ai nt logs "" grinned a bull - cook "" them 's sausages for the teamsters '  breakfast . ""  At Paul 's camp up where the little Gimlet empties into the Big Auger ,  newcomers used to kick because they were never served beans . The bosses  and the men could never be interested in beans . E. E. Terrill tells us  the reason :  Once when the cook quit they had to detail a substitute to the job  temporarily . There was one man who was no good anywhere . He had failed  at every job . Chris Crosshaul , the foreman , acting on the theory that  every man is good _ somewhere _ , figured that this guy must be a cook , for  it was the only job he had not tried . So he was put to work and the "	1	0
"When the heat took hold the beans swelled up till  they lifted off the roof and bulged out the walls . There was no way to  get into the place to cook anything else , so the whole crew turned in to  eat up the half cooked beans . By keeping at it steady they cleaned them  up in a week and rescued the would - be - cook . After that no one seemed to  care much for beans .  It used to be a big job to haul prune pits and coffee grounds away from  Paul 's camps . It required a big crew of men and either Babe or Benny to  do the hauling . Finally Paul decided it was cheaper to build new camps  and move every month .  The winter Paul logged off North Dakota with the Seven Axemen , the  Little Chore Boy and the 300 cooks , he worked the cooks in three  shifts -- one for each meal . The Seven Axemen were hearty eaters ; a  portion of bacon was one side of a 1600-pound pig . Paul shipped a  stern - wheel steamboat up Red River and they put it in the soup kettle to  stir the soup .  Like other artists , cooks are temperamental and some of them are full of  cussedness but the only ones who could sass Paul Bunyan and get away  with it were the stars like Big Joe and Sourdough Sam .  The lunch sled,--most popular institution in the lumber industry ! It 's  arrival at the noon rendezvous has been hailed with joy by hungry men on  every logging job since Paul invented it . What if the warm food freezes  on your tin plate , the keen cold air has sharpened your appetite to  enjoy it . The crew that toted lunch for Paul Bunyan had so far to travel  and so many to feed they hauled a complete kitchen on the lunch sled ,  cooks and all .         *        *        *        *        *  OVER thirty years ago The Red River Lumber Company , foreseeing the end  of their White Pine which was reached in 1915 , set out to find the pine  that would supply a trade that demands the qualities found in White  Pine . All the forests of North America were examined and exhaustively  studied and the selection was Sugar Pine and California White  Pine,--""the largest pines that ever grew "" and production started at  Westwood in 1914 .  SUGAR PINE,--""cork pine 's big brother , "" is botanically a White Pine with  all the family virtues that have made White Pine the standard from the  days of the Pilgrim Fathers to the period of "" cork "" White"	1	0
 CALIFORNIA WHITE PINE ranks second only to Sugar Pine in size and is  close to it in White Pine qualities . Botanically a Yellow Pine , its  texture has been so changed by climate and altitude that it in no way  resembles the Yellow Pines and is so much like White Pine that its trade  name is necessary to prevent confusion on the part of the consumer .  WHITE FIR is light , straight grained and easily worked . A smaller  percentage of upper grades than the big pines , but with knots so small  that the commons offer exceptional values and advantages . It is used for  concrete forms , sheathing , studding and for dairy containers and  packages that must be odorless and tasteless . It also makes a handsome  interior finish .  INCENSE CEDAR is used chiefly for pencils and chests -- a soft ,  straight - grained red cedar .  The Red River people strive for a quality of manufacture worthy of such  magnificent trees . The Westwood plant , electrically operated throughout ,  is a new departure in its field , with a capacity of 200 million feet a  year . Planned by our own engineers , much of the machinery and equipment  is of our own design and new standards of efficiency , economy and  precision of cutting have been set . Modern dry - kilns handle a large  part of the output and yield perfectly seasoned lumber , free from drying  defects , in a few days instead of the months required for air drying .  The plant operates the year ' round , logging , sawing , manufacturing and  shipping . Handicaps of a severe winter climate are overcome and frozen  logs are thawed in a steam - heated pond . Continuous operation gives  steady employment to skilled and experienced men and a rapid replacement  of stocks that makes Westwood a dependable source of supply for the  trade .  The large Red River factories at Westwood are equipped to supply every  known need of the trade and made - to - order specialties are quickly turned  out . The most modern machinery is used for cutting , finishing , glueing  and other operations .

" No two logging jobs can be handled exactly the same way so Paul adapted  his operations to local conditions . In the mountains he used Babe to  pull the kinks out of the crooked logging roads ; on the Big Onion he  began the system of hauling a section of land at a time to the landings  and in North Dakota he used the Seven Axemen .  At that time marking logs was not thought of , Paul had no need for  identification when there were no logs but his own . About the time he  started the Atlantic Ocean drive others had come into the industry and  although their combined cut was insignificant compared to Paul 's , there  was danger of confusion , and Paul had most to lose .  At first Paul marked his logs by pinching a piece out of each log . When  his cut grew so large that the marking had to be detailed to the crews ,  the "" scalp "" on each log was put on with an axe , for even in those days  not every man could nip out the chunk with his fingers .  The Grindstone was invented by Paul the winter he logged off North  Dakota . Before that Paul 's axemen had to sharpen their axes by rolling  rocks down hill and running along side of them . When they got to "" Big  Dick , "" as the lumberjacks called Dakota , hills and rocks were so hard to  find that Paul rigged up the revolving rock .  This was much appreciated by the Seven Axemen as it enabled them to  grind an axe in a week , but the grindstone was not much of a hit with  the Little Chore Boy whose job it was to turn it . The first stone was so  big that working at full speed , every time it turned around once it was  payday .  The Little Chore Boy led a strenuous life . He was only a kid and like  all youngsters putting in their first winter in the woods , he was put  over the jumps by the oldtimers . His regular work was heavy enough ,  splitting all the wood for the camp , carrying water and packing lunch to  the men , but his hazers sent him on all kinds of wild goose errands to  all parts of the works , looking for a "" left - handed peavy "" or a "" bundle  of cross - hauls . ""  He had to take a lot of good natured roughneck wit about his size for he  only weighed 800 pounds and a couple of surcingles made a belt for him .  What he lacked in size he made up in grit"	1	0
" Often in the evening , after his day 's work and long hours put in turning  the grindstone and keeping up fires in the camp stoves -- that required  four cords of wood apiece to kindle a fire , he could be found with one  of Big Ole 's small 600-pound anvils in his lap pegging up shoes with  railroad spikes .  It was a long time before they solved the problem of turning logging  sleds around in the road . When a sled returned from the landing and put  on a load they had to wait until Paul came along to pick up the four  horses and the load and head them the other way . Judson M. Goss says he  worked for Paul the winter he invented the round turn .  All of Paul 's inventions were successful except when he decided to run  three ten - hour shifts a day and installed the Aurora Borealis . After a  number of trials the plan was abandoned because the lights were not  dependable .         *        *        *        *        *  "" THE Seven Axemen of the Red River "" they were called because they had a  camp on Red River with the three - hundred cooks and the Little Chore Boy .  The whole State was cut over from the one camp and the husky seven  chopped from dark to dark and walked to and from work .  Their axes were so big it took a week to grind one of them . Each man had  three axes and two helpers to carry the spare axes to the river when  they got red hot from chopping . Even in those days they had to watch out  for forest fires . The axes were hung on long rope handles . Each axeman  would march through the timber whirling his axe around him till the hum  of it sounded like one of Paul 's fore - and - aft - mosquitoes , and at every  step a quarter - section of timber was cut .  The height , weight and chest measurement of the Seven Axemen are not  known . Authorities differ . History agrees that they kept a cord of  four - foot wood on the table for toothpicks . After supper they would sit  on the deacon seat in the bunk shanty and sing "" Shanty Boy "" and "" Bung  Yer Eye "" till the folks in the settlements down on the Atlantic would  think another nor'wester was blowing up .  Some say the Seven Axemen were Bay Chaleur men ; others declare they were  all cousins and came from down Machias way . Where they came from or  where they went to blow their stake after leaving Paul 's"	1	0
"Many trials  and experiments followed and then Paul invented the two - man saw .  The first saw was made from a strip trimmed off in making Big Joe 's  dinner horn and was long enough to reach across a quarter section , for  Paul could never think in smaller units . This saw worked all right in a  level country , in spite of the fact that all the trees fell back on the  saw , but in rough country only the trees on the hill tops were cut .  Trees in the valleys were cut off in the tops and in the pot holes the  saw passed over the trees altogether .  It took a good man to pull this saw in heavy timber when Paul was  working on the other end . Paul used to say to his fellow sawyer , "" I  do n't care if you ride the saw , but please do n't drag your feet . "" A  couple of cousins of Big Ole 's were given the job and did so well that  ever afterward in the Lake States the saw crews have generally been  Scandinavians .  It was after this that Paul had Big Ole make the "" Down - Cutter . "" This was  a rig like a mowing machine . They drove around eight townships and cut a  swath 500 feet wide .         *        *        *        *        *  THE Winter of the Deep Snow everything was buried . Paul had to dig down  to find the tops of the tallest White Pines . He had the snow dug away  around them and lowered his sawyers down to the base of the trees . When  the tree was cut off he hauled it to the surface with a long parbuckle  chain to which Babe , mounted on snowshoes , was hitched . It was  impossible to get enough stove pipe to reach to the top of the snow , so  Paul had Big Ole make stovepipe by boring out logs with a long six - inch  auger .  The year of the Two Winters they had winter all summer and then in the  fall it turned colder . One day Big Joe set the boiling coffeepot on the  stove and it froze so quick that the ice was hot . That was right after  Paul had built the Great Lakes and that winter they froze clear to the  bottom . They never would have thawed out if Paul had not chopped out the  ice and hauled it out on shore for the sun to melt . He finally got all  the ice thawed but he had to put in all new fish .  The next spring was the year the rain came"	1	0
Babe had to learn to eat pancakes  like Benny . That was the time Paul used the straw hats for an emergency  ration .  When Paul 's drive came down , folks in the settlements were astonished to  see all the river - pigs wearing huge straw hats . The reason for this was  soon apparent . When the fodder ran out every man was politely requested  to toss his hat into the ring . Hundreds of straw hats were used to make  a lunch for Babe .         *        *        *        *        *  TALK about a job for Paul Bunyan ! In 1913 the site of Westwood was  primeval forest , sixty mountainous miles from the nearest railroad .  Tractors , trucks and hundreds of horses freighted in materials before  the railroad was extended and when the future residents arrived the town  was complete to the last detail .  Not a shack in the town . Modern houses , sanitary sewers , waterworks ,  electricity , grade and high schools , hospital , church , clubs , up - to - date  department store , cafeteria , dairy , packing house , and cold storage ,  theatre , soda fountains , garage and ball park -- the 5,400 citizens of  Westwood enjoy comfortable homes , good schools , year ' round employment  at good wages , low living costs , and form one of the most - up - and - coming  communities in the progressive State of California .         *        *        *        *        *  LUCY , Paul Bunyan 's cow , was not , so far as we can learn , related in any  way to either Babe or Benny . Statements that she was their mother are  without basis in fact . The two oxen had been in Paul 's possession for a  long time before Lucy arrived on the scene .  No reliable data can be found as to the pedigree of this remarkable  dairy animal . There are no official records of her butter - fat production  nor is it known where or how Paul got her .  Paul always said that Lucy was part Jersey and part wolf . Maybe so . Her  actions and methods of living seemed to justify the allegation of wolf  ancestry , for she had an insatiable appetite and a roving disposition .  Lucy ate everything in sight and could never be fed at the same camp  with Babe or Benny . In fact , they quit trying to feed her at all but let  her forage her own living . The Winter of the Deep Snow , when even the  tallest White Pines were buried , Brimstone Bill outfitted Lucy with a  set of Babe	1	0
" In spite of short rations she gave enough milk to keep six men busy  skimming the cream . If she had been kept in a barn and fed regularly she  might have made a milking record . When she fed on the evergreen trees  and her milk got so strong of White Pine and Balsam that the men used it  for cough medicine and linament , they quit serving the milk on the table  and made butter out of it . By using this butter to grease the logging  roads when the snow and ice thawed off , Paul was able to run his logging  sleds all summer .         *        *        *        *        *  THE family life of Paul Bunyan , from all accounts , has been very happy .  A charming glimpse of Mrs. Bunyan is given by Mr. E. S. Shepard of  Rhinelander , Wis. , who tells of working in Paul 's camp on Round River in  ' 62 , the Winter of the Black Snow . Paul put him wheeling prune pits away  from the cook camp . After he had worked at this job for three months  Paul had him haul them all back again as Mrs. Bunyan , who was cooking at  the camp , wanted to use them to make the hot fires necessary to cook her  famous soft nosed pancakes .  Mrs. Bunyan , at this time used to call the men to dinner by blowing into  a woodpecker hole in an old hollow stub that stood near the door . In  this stub there was a nest of owls that had one short wing and flew in  circles . When Mr. Shepard made a sketch of Paul , Mrs. Bunyan , with  wifely solicitude for his appearance , parted Paul 's hair with a handaxe  and combed it with an old crosscut saw .  From other sources we have fragmentary glimpses of Jean , Paul 's youngest  son . When Jean was three weeks old he jumped from his cradle one night  and seizing an axe , chopped the four posts out from under his father 's  bed . The incident greatly tickled Paul , who used to brag about it to any  one who would listen to him . "" The boy is going to be a great logger some  day , "" he would declare with fatherly pride .  The last we heard of Jean he was working for a lumber outfit in the  South , lifting logging trains past one another on a single track  railroad .         *        *        *        *        *  IT is no picnic to tackle the wilderness and turn the very forest itself  into a commercial commodity delivered at the market ."	1	0
"Being a pioneer he had to invent all his stuff as he went along .  Many a time his plans were upset by the mistakes of some swivel - headed  strawboss or incompetent foreman . The winter of the blue snow , Shot  Gunderson had charge in the Big Tadpole River country . He landed all of  his logs in a lake and in the spring when ready to drive he boomed the  logs three times around the lake before he discovered there was no  outlet to it . High hills surrounded the lake and the drivable stream was  ten miles away . Apparently the logs were a total loss .  Then Paul came on the job himself and got busy . Calling in Sourdough  Sam , the cook who made everything but coffee out of sourdough , he  ordered him to mix enough sourdough to fill the big watertank . Hitching  Babe to the tank , he hauled it over and dumped it into the lake . When it  "" riz "" , as Sam said , a mighty lava - like stream poured forth and carried  the logs over the hills to the river . There is a landlocked lake in  Northern Minnesota that is called "" Sourdough Lake "" to this day .  Chris Crosshaul was a careless cuss . He took a big drive down the  Mississippi for Paul and when the logs were delivered in the New Orleans  boom it was found that he had driven the wrong logs . The owners looked  at the barkmarks and refused to accept them . It was up to Paul to drive  them back upstream .  No one but Paul Bunyan would ever tackle a job like that . To drive logs  upstream is impossible , but if you think a little thing like an  impossibility could stop him , you do n't know Paul Bunyan . He simply fed  Babe a good big salt ration and drove him to the upper Mississippi to  drink . Babe drank the river dry and sucked all the water upstream . The  logs came up river faster than they went down .         *        *        *        *        *  BIG Ole was the Blacksmith at Paul 's headquarters camp on the Big Onion .  Ole had a cranky disposition but he was a skilled workman . No job in  iron or steel was too big or too difficult for him . One of the cooks  used to make doughnuts and have Ole punch the holes . He made the griddle  on which Big Joe cast his pancakes , and the dinner horn that blew down  ten acres of pine . Ole was the only man who could shoe Babe or Benny .  Every time he made"	1	0
"Babe cast a shoe while  making a hard pull one day , and it was hurled for a mile and tore down  forty acres of pine and injured eight Swedes that were swamping out  skidways . Ole was also a mechanic and built the Downcutter , a rig like a  mowing machine that cut down a swath of trees 500 feet wide .         *        *        *        *        *  IN the early days , whenever Paul Bunyan was broke between logging  seasons , he travelled around like other lumberjacks doing any kind of  pioneering work he could find . He showed up in Washington about the time  The Puget Construction Co. was building Puget Sound and Billy Puget was  making records moving dirt with droves of dirt throwing badgers . Paul  and Billy got into an argument over who had shovelled the most . Paul got  mad and said he 'd show Billy Puget and started to throw the dirt back  again . Before Billy stopped him he had piled up the San Juan Islands .         *        *        *        *        *  WHEN a man gets the reputation in the woods of being a "" good man "" it  refers only to physical prowess . Frequently he is challenged to fight by  "" good men "" from other communities .  There was Pete Mufraw . "" You know Joe Mufraw ? "" "" Oui , two Joe Mufraw , one  named Pete . "" That 's the fellow . After Pete had licked everybody between  Quebec and Bay Chaleur he started to look for Paul Bunyan . He bragged  all over the country that he had worn out six pair of shoe - pacs looking  for Paul . Finally he met up with him .  Paul was plowing with two yoke of steers and Pete Mufraw stopped at the  brush - fence to watch the plow cut its way right through rocks and  stumps . When they reached the end of the furrow Paul picked up the plow  and the oxen with one arm and turned them around . Pete took one look and  then wandered off down the trail muttering , "" Hox an ' hall ! She 's lift  hox an ' hall .

In the early days he rode on the back of Babe , the Big Blue Ox . This had  it 's difficulties because he had"	1	0
"He started from  Minnesota for Westwood one Spring morning . There was still snow in the  woods so Paul wore his snowshoes . He soon ran out of the snow belt but  kept right on without reducing speed . Crossing the desert the heat  became oppressive , his mackinaws grew heavy and the snowshoes dragged  his feet but it was too late to turn back .  When he arrived in California he discovered that the sun and hot sand  had warped one of his shoes and pulled one foot out of line at every  step , so instead of travelling on a bee line and hitting Westwood  exactly , he came out at San Francisco . This made it necessary for him to  travel an extra three hundred miles north . It was late that night when  he pulled into Westwood and he had used up a whole day coming from  Minnesota .  Paul 's fast foot work made him a "" good man on the round stuff "" and in  spite of his weight he had no trouble running around on the floating  logs , even the small ones . It was said that Paul could spin a log till  the bark came off and then run ashore on the bubbles . He once threw a  peavy handle into the Mississippi at St. Louis and standing on it , poled  up to Brainerd , Minnesota . Paul was a "" white water bucko "" and rode water  so rough it would tear an ordinary man in two to drink out of the river .         *        *        *        *        *  JOHNNY Inkslinger was Paul 's headquarters clerk . He invented bookkeeping  about the time Paul invented logging . He was something of a genius and  perfected his own office appliances to increase efficiency . His fountain  pen was made by running a hose from a barrel of ink and with it he could  "" daub out a walk "" quicker than the recipient of the pay - off could tie  the knot in his tussick rope .  One winter Johnny left off crossing the "" t 's "" and dotting the "" i 's "" and  saved nine barrels of ink . The lumberjacks accused him of using a split  pencil to charge up the tobacco and socks they bought at the wanagan but  this was just bunkshanty talk ( is this the origin of the classic term  "" the bunk "" ? ) for Johnny never cheated anyone .         *        *        *        *        *  HAVE you ever encountered the Mosquito of the North Country ? You thought  they were pretty well developed animals with keen appetites did n't you ?  Then you can appreciate what Paul"	1	0
Now they rarely  weigh more than a pound or measure more than fourteen or fifteen inches  from tip to tip .  Paul had to keep his men and oxen in the camps with doors and windows  barred . Men armed with pike - poles and axes fought off the insects that  tore the shakes off the roof in their efforts to gain entrance . The big  buck mosquitoes fought among themselves and trampled down the weaker  members of the swarm and to this alone Paul Bunyan and his crew owe  their lives .  Paul determined to conquer the mosquitoes before another season arrived .  He thought of the big Bumble Bees back home and sent for several yoke of  them . These , he hoped would destroy the mosquitoes . Sourdough Sam  brought out two pair of the bees , overland on foot . There was no other  way to travel for the flight of the beasts could not be controlled .  Their wings were strapped with surcingles , they checked their stingers  with Sam and walking shoes were provided for them . Sam brought them  through without losing a bee .  The cure was worse than the original trouble . The Mosquitoes and the  Bees made a hit with each other . They soon intermarried and their  off - spring , as often happens , were worse than their parents . They had  stingers fore - and - aft and could get you coming or going .  Their bee blood caused their downfall in the long run . Their craving for  sweets could only be satisfied by sugar and molasses in large  quantities , for what is a flower to an insect with a ten - gallon stomach ?  One day the whole tribe flew across Lake Superior to attack a fleet of  ships bringing sugar to Paul 's camps . They destroyed the ships but ate  so much sugar they could not fly and all were drowned .  One pair of the original bees were kept at headquarters camp and  provided honey for the pancakes for many years .         *        *        *        *        *  IF Paul Bunyan did not invent Geography he created a lot of it . The  Great Lakes were first constructed to provide a water hole for Babe the  Big Blue Ox . Just what year this work was done is not known but they  were in use prior to the Year of the Two Winters .  The Winter Paul Bunyan logged off North Dakota he hauled water for his  ice roads from the Great Lakes . One day when Brimstone Bill had Babe  hitched to one of the old water tanks and was making his early morning  trip , the tank sprung a	1	0
"This was the beginning of the  Mississippi River and the truth of this is established by the fact that  the old Mississippi is still flowing .  The cook 's in Paul 's camps used a lot of water and to make things handy ,  they used to dig wells near the cook shanty . At headquarters on the Big  Auger , on top of the hill near the mouth of the Little Gimlet , Paul dug  a well so deep that it took all day for the bucket to fall to the water ,  and a week to haul it up . They had to run so many buckets that the well  was forty feet in diameter . It was shored up with tamarac poles and when  the camp was abandoned Paul pulled up this cribbing . Travellers who have  visited the spot say that the sand has blown away until 178 feet of the  well is sticking up into the air , forming a striking landmark .         *        *        *        *        *  WHAT is camp without a dog ? Paul Bunyan loved dogs as well as the next  man but never would have one around that could not earn its keep . Paul 's  dogs had to work , hunt or catch rats . It took a good dog to kill the  rats and mice in Paul 's camps for the rodents picked up scraps of the  buffalo milk pancakes and grew to be as big as two year old bears .  Elmer , the moose terrier , practiced up on the rats when he was a small  pup and was soon able to catch a moose on the run and finish it with one  shake . Elmer loafed around the cook camp and if the meat supply happened  to run low the cook would put the dog out the door and say , "" Bring in a  moose . "" Elmer would run into the timber , catch a moose and bring it in  and repeat the performance until , after a few minutes work , the cook  figured he had enough for a mess and would call the dog in .  Sport , the reversible dog , was really the best hunter . He was part wolf  and part elephant hound and was raised on bear milk . One night when  Sport was quite young , he was playing around in the horse barn and Paul ,  mistaking him for a mouse , threw a hand axe at him . The axe cut the dog  in two but Paul , instantly realizing what had happened , quickly stuck  the two halves together , gave the pup first aid and bandaged him up .  With careful nursing the dog soon recovered and then"	1	0
"Because of this he never tired and  anything he started after got caught . Sport never got his full growth .  While still a pup he broke through four feet of ice on Lake Superior and  was drowned .  As a hunter , Paul would make old Nimrod himself look like a city dude  lost from his guide . He was also a good fisherman . Oldtimers tell of  seeing Paul as a small boy , fishing off the Atlantic Coast . He would  sail out early in the morning in his three - mast schooner and wade back  before breakfast with his boat full of fish on his shoulder .  About this time he got his shot gun that required four dishpans full of  powder and a keg of spikes to load each barrel . With this gun he could  shoot geese so high in the air they would spoil before reaching the  ground .  Tracking was Paul 's favorite sport and no trail was too old or too dim  for him to follow . He once came across the skeleton of a moose that had  died of old age and , just for curiosity , picked up the tracks of the  animal and spent the whole afternoon following its trail back to the  place where it was born .  The shaggy dog that spent most of his time pretending to sleep in front  of Johnny Inkslinger 's counter in the camp office was Fido , the watch  dog . Fido was the bug - bear ( not bearer , just bear ) of the greenhorns .  They were told that Paul starved Fido all winter and then , just before  payday , fed him all the swampers , barn boys and student bull - cooks . The  very marrow was frozen in their heads at the thought of being turned  into dog food . Their fears were groundless for Paul would never let a  dog go hungry or mistreat a human being . Fido was fed all the watch  peddlers , tailors ' agents , and camp inspectors and thus served a very  useful purpose .         *        *        *        *        *  WHEN Paul Bunyan took up efficiency engineering he went at the job with  all his customary thoroughness . He did not fool around clocking the crew  with a stop watch , counting motions and deducting the ones used for  borrowing chews , going for drinks , dodging the boss and preparing for  quitting time . He decided to cut out labor altogether .  "" What 's the use , "" said Paul , "" of all this sawing , swamping , skidding ,  decking , grading and icing roads , loading , hauling and landing ?

This simplified matters and made the work a lot easier . Six trips  a day , six days a week just cleaned up a township for section 37 was  never hauled back to the woods on Saturday night but was left on the  landing to wash away in the early spring when the drive went out .  Documentary evidence of the truth of this is offered by the United  States government surveys . Look at any map that shows the land  subdivisions and you will never find a township with more than  thirty - six sections .  The foregoing statement , previously published , has caused some  controversy . Mr. T. S. Sowell of Miami , Florida wrote to us citing the  townships in his State that have sections numbered 37 to 40 . He said  that the government survey had been complicated by the old Spanish land  grants . We put the matter up to Paul Bunyan and from his camp near  Westwood came this reply :      Red River Advertising Department .       Dear Sir : Yes sir , I remember those sections and a lot of       bother they made me too . One winter when I was starting the       White Pine business and snaking sections down to the Atlantic       Ocean , a man from Florida came along and ordered a bunch of       sections delivered down to his place . He wanted to see if he       could grow the same kind of White Pine down there . I yarded out       a nice bunch of sections and next summer when my drive was in       and I was n't busy I took a crew of Canada Boys and Mainites and       poled them down the coast . When I come to collect they said       this man was gone looking for a Fountain of Youth or some fool       thing .       I do n't know what luck he had with his White Pine ranch . I       never seen them again . I had a lot of other things to tend to       and clean forgot it till you sent me Mr. Sowell 's letter . Maybe       that man was a Spaniard I do n't know .                                           Yours respectively ,                                                          P.

" As he shoved off from France , Paul sent a wireless to New York but  passed the Statue of Liberty three lengths ahead of the message . From  New York to Westwood he travelled on skis . When the home folks asked him  if the Allegheney Mountains and the Rockies had bothered him , Paul  replied , "" I did n't notice any mountains but the trail was a little bumpy  in a couple of spots .

"He tried to beg off  that morning , for he was very busy , but she would not let him . So he  began :  "" Well , once there was a little pig-- ""  She put her hand over his mouth and stopped him at the word . She said  she had heard little pig - stories till she was perfectly sick of them .  "" Well , what kind of story _ shall _ I tell , then ? ""  "" About Christmas . It 's getting to be the season . It 's past Thanksgiving  already . ""  "" It seems to me , "" her papa argued , "" that I 've told as often about  Christmas as I have about little pigs . ""  "" No difference ! Christmas is more interesting . ""  "" Well ! "" Her papa roused himself from his writing by a great effort .  "" Well , then , I 'll tell you about the little girl that wanted it  Christmas every day in the year . How would you like that ? ""  "" First - rate ! "" said the little girl ; and she nestled into comfortable  shape in his lap , ready for listening .  "" Very well , then , this little pig -- Oh , what are you pounding me for ? ""  "" Because you said little pig instead of little girl . ""  "" I should like to know what 's the difference between a little pig and a  little girl that wanted it Christmas every day ! ""  "" Papa , "" said the little girl , warningly , "" if you do n't go on , I 'll  _ give _ it to you ! "" And at this her papa darted off like lightning , and  began to tell the story as fast as he could .    Well , once there was a little girl who liked Christmas so much that    she wanted it to be Christmas every day in the year ; and as soon as    Thanksgiving was over she began to send postal - cards to the old    Christmas Fairy to ask if she might n't have it . But the old fairy    never answered any of the postals ; and after a while the little girl    found out that the Fairy was pretty particular , and would n't notice    anything but letters -- not even correspondence cards in envelopes ; but    real letters on sheets of paper , and sealed outside with a    monogram -- or your initial , anyway . So , then , she began to send her    letters ; and in about three weeks -- or just the day before Christmas ,    it was -- she got a"	1	0
"She just resolved to keep it to    herself , and surprise everybody with it as it kept coming true ; and    then it slipped out of her mind altogether .    She had a splendid Christmas . She went to bed early , so as to let    Santa Claus have a chance at the stockings , and in the morning she was    up the first of anybody and went and felt them , and found hers all    lumpy with packages of candy , and oranges and grapes , and pocket - books    and rubber balls , and all kinds of small presents , and her big    brother 's with nothing but the tongs in them , and her young lady    sister 's with a new silk umbrella , and her papa 's and mamma 's with    potatoes and pieces of coal wrapped up in tissue - paper , just as they    always had every Christmas . Then she waited around till the rest of    the family were up , and she was the first to burst into the library ,    when the doors were opened , and look at the large presents laid out on    the library - table -- books , and portfolios , and boxes of stationery , and    breastpins , and dolls , and little stoves , and dozens of handkerchiefs ,    and ink - stands , and skates , and snow - shovels , and photograph - frames ,    and little easels , and boxes of water - colors , and Turkish paste , and    nougat , and candied cherries , and dolls ' houses , and waterproofs -- and    the big Christmas - tree , lighted and standing in a waste - basket in the    middle .    She had a splendid Christmas all day . She ate so much candy that she    did not want any breakfast ; and the whole forenoon the presents kept    pouring in that the expressman had not had time to deliver the night    before ; and she went round giving the presents she had got for other    people , and came home and ate turkey and cranberry for dinner , and    plum - pudding and nuts and raisins and oranges and more candy , and then    went out and coasted , and came in with a stomach - ache , crying ; and her    papa said he would see if his house was turned into that sort of    fool 's paradise another year ; and they had a light supper , and pretty    early everybody went to bed cross .  Here the little girl pounded her papa in the back , again .  "" Well , what now ? Did I say pigs ? ""  "" You made them _ act _ like pigs . ""  """	1	0
"  Her father went on :    The little girl slept very heavily , and she slept very late , but she    was wakened at last by the other children dancing round her bed with    their stockings full of presents in their hands .     What is it ? "" said the little girl , and she rubbed her eyes and tried    to rise up in bed .    "" Christmas ! Christmas ! Christmas ! "" they all shouted , and waved their    stockings .    "" Nonsense ! It was Christmas yesterday . ""    Her brothers and sisters just laughed . "" We do n't know about that . It 's    Christmas to - day , anyway . You come into the library and see . ""    Then all at once it flashed on the little girl that the Fairy was    keeping her promise , and her year of Christmases was beginning . She    was dreadfully sleepy , but she sprang up like a lark -- a lark that had    overeaten itself and gone to bed cross -- and darted into the library .    There it was again ! Books , and portfolios , and boxes of stationery ,    and breastpins--  "" You need n't go over it all , papa ; I guess I can remember just what was  there , "" said the little girl .    Well , and there was the Christmas - tree blazing away , and the family    picking out their presents , but looking pretty sleepy , and her father    perfectly puzzled , and her mother ready to cry . "" I 'm sure I do n't see    how I 'm to dispose of all these things , "" said her mother , and her    father said it seemed to him they had had something just like it the    day before , but he supposed he must have dreamed it . This struck the    little girl as the best kind of a joke ; and so she ate so much candy    she did n't want any breakfast , and went round carrying presents , and    had turkey and cranberry for dinner , and then went out and coasted ,    and came in with a--  "" Papa ! ""  "" Well , what now ? ""  "" What did you promise , you forgetful thing ? ""  "" Oh ! oh yes ! ""    Well , the next day , it was just the same thing over again , but    everybody getting crosser ; and at the end of a week 's time so many    people had lost their tempers that you could pick up lost tempers    anywhere ; they perfectly strewed the ground . Even when people tried to    recover their tempers they usually got somebody else"	1	0
"So it went on and    on , and it was Christmas on St. Valentine 's Day and Washington 's    Birthday , just the same as any day , and it did n't skip even the First    of April , though everything was counterfeit that day , and that was    some _ little _ relief .    After a while coal and potatoes began to be awfully scarce , so many    had been wrapped up in tissue - paper to fool papas and mammas with .    Turkeys got to be about a thousand dollars apiece--  "" Papa ! ""  "" Well , what ? ""  "" You 're beginning to fib . ""  "" Well , _ two _ thousand , then . ""    And they got to passing off almost anything for turkeys -- half - grown    humming - birds , and even rocs out of the _ Arabian Nights_--the real    turkeys were so scarce . And cranberries -- well , they asked a diamond    apiece for cranberries . All the woods and orchards were cut down for    Christmas - trees , and where the woods and orchards used to be it    looked just like a stubble - field , with the stumps . After a while they    had to make Christmas - trees out of rags , and stuff them with bran ,    like old - fashioned dolls ; but there were plenty of rags , because    people got so poor , buying presents for one another , that they    could n't get any new clothes , and they just wore their old ones to    tatters . They got so poor that everybody had to go to the poor - house ,    except the confectioners , and the fancy - store keepers , and the    picture - book sellers , and the expressmen ; and _ they _ all got so rich    and proud that they would hardly wait upon a person when he came to    buy . It was perfectly shameful !    Well , after it had gone on about three or four months , the little    girl , whenever she came into the room in the morning and saw those    great ugly , lumpy stockings dangling at the fire - place , and the    disgusting presents around everywhere , used to just sit down and    burst out crying . In six months she was perfectly exhausted ; she    could n't even cry any more ; she just lay on the lounge and rolled her    eyes and panted . About the beginning of October she took to sitting    down on dolls wherever she found them -- French dolls , or any kind -- she    hated the sight of them so ; and by Thanksgiving she was crazy , and    just slammed her presents"	1	0
"They    flung them over the fence , or through the window , or anything ; and ,    instead of running their tongues out and taking great pains to write    "" For dear Papa , "" or "" Mamma , "" or "" Brother , "" or "" Sister , "" or "" Susie , "" or    "" Sammie , "" or "" Billie , "" or "" Bobbie , "" or "" Jimmie , "" or "" Jennie , "" or    whoever it was , and troubling to get the spelling right , and then    signing their names , and "" Xmas , 18 - - , "" they used to write in the    gift - books , "" Take it , you horrid old thing ! "" and then go and bang it    against the front door . Nearly everybody had built barns to hold their    presents , but pretty soon the barns overflowed , and then they used to    let them lie out in the rain , or anywhere . Sometimes the police used    to come and tell them to shovel their presents off the sidewalk , or    they would arrest them .  "" I thought you said everybody had gone to the poor - house , "" interrupted  the little girl .  "" They did go , at first , "" said her papa ; "" but after a while the  poor - houses got so full that they had to send the people back to their  own houses . They tried to cry , when they got back , but they could n't  make the least sound . ""  "" Why could n't they ? ""  "" Because they had lost their voices , saying ' Merry Christmas ' so much .  Did I tell you how it was on the Fourth of July ? ""  "" No ; how was it ? "" And the little girl nestled closer , in expectation of  something uncommon .    Well , the night before , the boys stayed up to celebrate , as they    always do , and fell asleep before twelve o'clock , as usual , expecting    to be wakened by the bells and cannon . But it was nearly eight o'clock    before the first boy in the United States woke up , and then he found    out what the trouble was . As soon as he could get his clothes on he    ran out of the house and smashed a big cannon - torpedo down on the    pavement ; but it did n't make any more noise than a damp wad of paper ;    and after he tried about twenty or thirty more , he began to pick them    up and look at them . Every single torpedo was a big raisin ! Then"	1	0
"Some men got together before night , with a little powder    that had n't turned into purple sugar yet , and they said they would    fire off _ one _ cannon , anyway . But the cannon burst into a thousand    pieces , for it was nothing but rock - candy , and some of the men nearly    got killed . The Fourth of July orations all turned into Christmas    carols , and when anybody tried to read the Declaration , instead of    saying , "" When in the course of human events it becomes necessary , "" he    was sure to sing , "" God rest you , merry gentlemen . "" It was perfectly    awful .  The little girl drew a deep sigh of satisfaction .  "" And how was it at Thanksgiving ? ""  Her papa hesitated . "" Well , I 'm almost afraid to tell you . I 'm afraid  you 'll think it 's wicked . ""  "" Well , tell , anyway , "" said the little girl .    Well , before it came Thanksgiving it had leaked out who had caused all    these Christmases . The little girl had suffered so much that she had    talked about it in her sleep ; and after that hardly anybody would play    with her . People just perfectly despised her , because if it had not    been for her greediness it would n't have happened ; and now , when it    came Thanksgiving , and she wanted them to go to church , and have    squash - pie and turkey , and show their gratitude , they said that all    the turkeys had been eaten up for her old Christmas dinners , and if    she would stop the Christmases , they would see about the gratitude .    Was n't it dreadful ? And the very next day the little girl began to    send letters to the Christmas Fairy , and then telegrams , to stop it .    But it did n't do any good ; and then she got to calling at the Fairy 's    house , but the girl that came to the door always said , "" Not at home , ""    or "" Engaged , "" or "" At dinner , "" or something like that ; and so it went    on till it came to the old once - a - year Christmas Eve . The little girl    fell asleep , and when she woke up in the morning--  "" She found it was all nothing but a dream , "" suggested the little girl .  "" No , indeed ! "" said her papa . "" It was all every bit true ! ""  "" Well , what _ did _ she find out , then ? """	1	0
" "" You sha'n't go if you 're going to leave it _ so _ ! ""  "" How do you want it left ? ""  "" Christmas once a year . ""  "" All right , "" said her papa ; and he went on again .    Well , there was the greatest rejoicing all over the country , and it    extended clear up into Canada . The people met together everywhere , and    kissed and cried for joy . The city carts went around and gathered up    all the candy and raisins and nuts , and dumped them into the river ;    and it made the fish perfectly sick ; and the whole United States , as    far out as Alaska , was one blaze of bonfires , where the children were    burning up their gift - books and presents of all kinds . They had the    greatest _ time _ !    The little girl went to thank the old Fairy because she had stopped    its being Christmas , and she said she hoped she would keep her promise    and see that Christmas never , never came again . Then the Fairy    frowned , and asked her if she was sure she knew what she meant ; and    the little girl asked her , Why not ? and the old Fairy said that now    she was behaving just as greedily as ever , and she 'd better look out .    This made the little girl think it all over carefully again , and she    said she would be willing to have it Christmas about once in a    thousand years ; and then she said a hundred , and then she said ten ,    and at last she got down to one . Then the Fairy said that was the good    old way that had pleased people ever since Christmas began , and she    was agreed . Then the little girl said , "" What 're your shoes made of ? ""    And the Fairy said , "" Leather . "" And the little girl said , "" Bargain 's    done forever , "" and skipped off , and hippity - hopped the whole way home ,    she was so glad .  "" How will that do ? "" asked the papa .  "" First - rate ! "" said the little girl ; but she hated to have the story  stop , and was rather sober . However , her mamma put her head in at the  door , and asked her papa :  "" Are you never coming to breakfast ? What have you been telling that  child ? ""  "" Oh , just a moral tale . ""  The little girl caught him around the neck again .  "" _ We"	1	0
"   Yes ; but you need n't begin that way , papa , "" said the little girl ; "" I 'm  not going to have any moral to it this time . ""  "" No , indeed ! But it can be a true story , ca n't it ? ""  "" I do n't know , "" said the little girl ; "" I like made - up ones . ""  "" Well , this is going to be a true one , anyway , and it 's no use  talking . ""    All the relations in the neighborhood had come to dinner , and then    gone back to their own houses , but some of the relations had come from    a distance , and these had to stay all night at the grandfather 's . But    whether they went or whether they stayed , they all told the    grandmother that they did believe it was the best Thanksgiving dinner    they had ever eaten in their born days . They had had cranberry sauce ,    and they 'd had mashed potato , and they 'd had mince - pie and pandowdy ,    and they 'd had celery , and they 'd had Hubbard squash , and they 'd had    tea and coffee both , and they 'd had apple - dumpling with hard sauce ,    and they 'd had hot biscuit and sweet pickle , and mangoes , and frosted    cake , and nuts , and cauliflower--  "" Do n't mix them all up so ! "" pleaded the little girl . "" It 's perfectly  confusing . I ca n't hardly tell _ what _ they had now . ""  "" Well , _ they _ mixed them up just in the same way , and I suppose that 's  one of the reasons why it happened . ""    Whenever a child wanted to go back from dumpling and frosted cake to    mashed potato and Hubbard squash -- they were old - fashioned kind of    people , and they had everything on the table at once , because the    grandmother and the aunties cooked it , and they could n't keep jumping    up all the time to change the plates -- and its mother said it    should n't , its grandmother said , Indeed it should , then , and helped it    herself ; and the child 's father would say , Well , he guessed _ he _ would    go back , too , for a change ; and the child 's mother would say , She    should think he would be ashamed ; and then they would get to going    back , till everything was perfectly higgledy - piggledy .

"It    was a gobbler , I tell you , that was nearly as big as a giraffe .  "" Papa ! ""    It took the premium at the county fair , and when it was dressed it    weighed fifteen pounds -- well , maybe twenty -- and it was so heavy that    the grandmothers and the aunties could n't put it on the table , and    they had to get one of the papas to do it . You ought to have heard the    hurrahing when the children saw him coming in from the kitchen with    it . It seemed as if they could n't hardly talk of anything but that    turkey the whole dinner - time .    The grandfather hated to carve , and so one of the papas did it ; and    whenever he gave anybody a piece , the grandfather would tell some new    story about the turkey , till pretty soon the aunties got to saying ,    "" Now , father , stop ! "" and one of them said it made it seem as if the    gobbler was walking about on the table , to hear so much about him , and    it took her appetite all away ; and that made the papas begin to ask    the grandfather more and more about the turkey .  "" Yes , "" said the little girl , thoughtfully ; "" I know what _ papas _ are . ""  "" Yes , they 're pretty much all alike . ""    And the mammas began to say they acted like a lot of silly boys ; and    what would the children think ? But nothing could stop it ; and all    through the afternoon and evening , whenever the papas saw any of the    aunties or mammas round , they would begin to ask the grandfather more    particulars about the turkey . The grandfather was pretty forgetful ,    and he told the same things right over . Well , and so it went on till    it came bedtime , and then the mammas and aunties began to laugh and    whisper together , and to say they did believe they should dream about    that turkey ; and when the papas kissed the grandmother good - night ,    they said , Well , they must have his mate for Christmas ; and then they    put their arms round the mammas and went out haw - hawing .  "" I do n't think they behaved very dignified , "" said the little girl .  "" Well , you see , they were just funning , and had got going , and it was  Thanksgiving , anyway . ""    Well , in about half an hour everybody was fast asleep and dreaming--  "" Is it going to be"	1	0
"   How can it be a dream , then ? ""  "" You said everybody was fast asleep and dreaming . ""  "" Well , but I had n't got through . Everybody _ except _ one little girl . ""  "" Now , papa ! ""  "" What ? ""  "" Do n't you go and say her name was the same as mine , and her eyes the  same color . ""  "" What an idea ! ""    _ This _ was a very _ good _ little girl , and very respectful to her papa ,    and did n't suspect him of tricks , but just believed everything he    said . And she was a very pretty little girl , and had red eyes , and    blue cheeks , and straight hair , and a curly nose--  "" Now , papa , if you get to cutting up-- ""  "" Well , I wo n't , then ! ""    Well , she was rather a delicate little girl , and whenever she    over - ate , or anything ,  "" Have bad dreams ! Aha ! I _ told _ you it was going to be a dream . ""  "" You wait till I get through . ""    She was apt to lie awake thinking , and some of her thinks were pretty    dismal . Well , that night , instead of thinking and tossing and turning ,    and counting a thousand , it seemed to this other little girl that she    began to see things as soon as she had got warm in bed , and before ,    even . And the first thing she saw was a large ,   bronze - colored--  "" Turkey gobbler ! ""  "" No , ma'am . Turkey gobbler 's _ ghost _ . ""  "" Foo ! "" said the little girl , rather uneasily ; "" whoever heard of a  turkey 's ghost , I should like to know ? ""  "" Never mind , that , "" said the papa . "" If it had n't been a ghost , could the  moonlight have shone through it ? No , indeed ! The stuffing would n't have  let it . So you see it must have been a ghost . ""    It had a red pasteboard placard round its neck , with FIRST PREMIUM    printed on it , and so she knew that it was the ghost of the very    turkey they had had for dinner . It was perfectly awful when it put up    its tail , and dropped its wings , and strutted just the way the    grandfather said it used to do . It seemed to be in a wide pasture ,    like that back"	1	0
"Two of them carried a platter of chicken pie ,    and there was a large pumpkin jack - o'-lantern hanging to the bedpost    to light the room , and it looked just like the other little girl 's    brother in the face , only perfectly ridiculous .    Then the old gobbler , First Premium , clapped his wings , and said ,    "" Come on , chick - chickledren ! "" and then they all seemed to be in her    room , and she was standing in the middle of it in her night - gown ,    and tied round and round with ribbons , so she could n't move hand or    foot . The old gobbler , First Premium , said they were going to turn the    tables now , and she knew what he meant , for they had had that in the    reader at school just before vacation , and the teacher had explained    it . He made a long speech , with his hat on , and kept pointing at her    with one of his wings , while he told the other turkeys that it was her    grandfather who had done it , and now it was their turn . He said that    human beings had been eating turkeys ever since the discovery of    America , and it was time for the turkeys to begin paying them back , if    they were ever going to . He said she was pretty young , but she was as    big as he was , and he had no doubt they would enjoy her .    The other little girl tried to tell him that she was not to blame , and    that she only took a very , very little piece .    "" But it was right off the breast , "" said the gobbler , and he shed    tears , so that the other little girl cried , too . She did n't have much    hopes , they all seemed so spiteful , especially the little turkey    chicks ; but she told them that she was very tender - hearted , and never    hurt a single thing , and she tried to make them understand that there    was a great difference between eating people and just eating turkeys .    "" What difference , I should like to know ? "" says the old hen - turkey ,    pretty snappishly .    "" People have got souls , and turkeys have n't , "" says the other little    girl .    "" I do n't see how _ that _ makes it any better , "" says the old hen - turkey .    "" It do n't make it any better for the _ turkeys _ . If we have n't got any    souls , we ca n't live"	1	0
" "" I should think she would ' a ' been , "" said the little girl ; and she  cuddled snugger into her papa 's arms . "" What _ could _ she say ? Ugh ! Go  on . ""    Well , she did n't know what to say , that 's a fact . You see , she never    thought of it in that light before . All she could say was , "" Well ,    people have got reason , anyway , and turkeys have only got instinct ; so    there ! ""    "" You 'd better look out , "" says the old hen - turkey ; and all the little    turkey chicks got so mad they just hopped , and the oldest little    he - turkey , that was just beginning to be a gobbler , he dropped his    wings and spread his tail just like his father , and walked round the    other little girl till it was perfectly frightful .  "" I should think they would ' a ' been ashamed . ""    Well , perhaps old First Premium _ was _ a little ; because he stopped    them . "" My dear , "" he says to the old hen - turkey , and chick - chickledren ,    "" you forget yourselves ; you should have a little consideration .    Perhaps you would n't behave much better yourselves if you were just    going to be eaten . ""    And they all began to scream and to cry , "" We 've _ been _ eaten , and    we 're nothing but turkey ghosts . ""  "" _ There _ , now , papa , "" says the little girl , sitting up straight , so as  to argue better , "" I _ knew _ it was n't true , all along . How could turkeys  have ghosts if they do n't have souls , I should like to know ? ""  "" Oh , easily , "" said the papa .  "" Tell how , "" said the little girl .  "" Now look here , "" said the papa , "" are you telling this story , or am I ? ""  "" You are , "" said the little girl , and she cuddled down again . "" Go on . ""  "" Well , then , do n't you interrupt . Where was I ? Oh yes . ""    Well , he could n't do anything with them , old First Premium could n't .    They acted perfectly ridiculous , and one little brat of a spiteful    little chick piped out , "" I speak for a drumstick , ma ! "" and then they    all began : "" I want a wing , ma !"	1	0
" Go on .     Well , old First Premium tried to quiet them again , and when he    could n't he apologized to the other little girl so nicely that she    began to like him . He said they did n't mean any harm by it ; they were    just excited , and chickledren would be chickledren .    "" Yes , "" said the other little girl , "" but I think you might take some    older person to begin with . It 's a perfect shame to begin with a    little girl . ""    "" Begin ! "" says old First Premium . "" Do you think we 're just _ beginning _ ?    Why , when do you think it is ? ""    "" The night after Thanksgiving . ""    "" What year ? ""    "" 1886 . ""    They all gave a perfect screech . "" Why , it 's Christmas Eve , 1900 , and    every one of your friends has been eaten up long ago , "" says old First    Premium , and he began to cry over her , and the old hen - turkey and the    little turkey chicks began to wipe their eyes on the backs of their    wings .  "" I do n't think they were very neat , "" said the little girl .  Well , they were kind - hearted , anyway , and they felt sorry for the other  little girl . And she began to think she had made some little impression  on them , when she noticed the old hen - turkey beginning to untie her  bonnet strings , and the turkey chicks began to spread round her in a  circle , with the points of their wings touching , so that she could n't  get out , and they commenced dancing and singing , and after a while that  little he - turkey says , "" Who 's _ it _ ? "" and the other little girl , she  did n't know why , says , "" _ I 'm _ it , "" and old First Premium says , "" Do you  promise ? "" and the other little girl says , "" Yes , I promise , "" and she knew  she was promising , if they would let her go , that people should never  eat turkeys any more . And the moon began to shine brighter and brighter  through the turkeys , and pretty soon it was the sun , and then it was not  the turkeys , but the window - curtains -- it was one of those old  farm - houses where they do n't have blinds -- and the other little girl--  "" Woke up !

"   What was it , then ? ""  "" It was a -- trance . ""  The little girl turned round , and knelt in her papa 's lap , so as to take  him by the shoulders and give him a good shaking . That made him promise  to be good , pretty quick , and , "" Very well , then , "" says the little girl ;  "" if it was n't a dream , you 've got to prove it . ""  "" But how can I prove it ? "" says the papa .  "" By going on with the story , "" says the little girl , and she cuddled down  again .  "" Oh , well , that 's easy enough . ""    As soon as it was light in the room , the other little girl could see    that the place was full of people , crammed and jammed , and they were    all awfully excited , and kept yelling , "" Down with the traitress ! ""    "" Away with the renegade ! "" "" Shame on the little sneak ! "" till it was    worse than the turkeys , ten times .    She knew that they meant her , and she tried to explain that she just    _ had _ to promise , and that if they had been in her place they would    have promised too ; and of course they could do as they pleased about    keeping her word , but she was going to keep it , anyway , and never ,    never , never eat another piece of turkey either at Thanksgiving or at    Christmas .    "" Very well , then , "" says an old lady , who looked like her grandmother ,    and then began to have a crown on , and to turn into Queen Victoria ,    "" what _ can _ we have ? ""    "" Well , "" says the other little girl , "" you can have oyster soup . ""    "" What else ? ""    "" And you can have cranberry sauce . ""    "" What else ? ""    "" You can have mashed potatoes , and Hubbard squash , and celery , and    turnip , and cauliflower . ""    "" What else ? ""    "" You can have mince - pie , and pandowdy , and plum - pudding . ""    "" And not a thing on the list , "" says the Queen , "" that does n't go with    turkey ! Now you see . ""  The papa stopped .  "" Go on , "" said the little girl .  "" There is n't any more . ""  The little girl turned round , got up on"	1	0
" Now , will you  go on ? What _ did _ the people eat in place of turkey ?   "" I do n't know . ""  "" You do n't know , you awful papa ! Well , then , what did the little girl  eat ? ""  "" She ? "" The papa freed himself , and made his preparation to escape . "" Why  she -- oh , _ she _ ate goose . Goose is tenderer than turkey , anyway , and  more digestible ; and there is n't so much of it , and you ca n't overeat  yourself , and have bad-- ""  "" Dreams ! "" cried the little girl .  "" Trances , "" said the papa , and she began to chase him all round the  room .  THE PONY ENGINE AND THE PACIFIC EXPRESS .  Christmas Eve , after the children had hung up their stockings and got  all ready for St. Nic , they climbed up on the papa 's lap to kiss him  good - night , and when they both got their arms round his neck , they said  they were not going to bed till he told them a Christmas story . Then he  saw that he would have to mind , for they were awfully severe with him ,  and always made him do exactly what they told him ; it was the way they  had brought him up . He tried his best to get out of it for a while ; but  after they had shaken him first this side , and then that side , and  pulled him backward and forward till he did not know where he was , he  began to think perhaps he had better begin . The first thing he said ,  after he opened his eyes , and made believe he had been asleep , or  something , was , "" Well , what did I leave off at ? "" and that made them just  perfectly boiling , for they understood his tricks , and they knew he was  trying to pretend that he had told part of the story already ; and they  said he had not left off anywhere because he had not commenced , and he  saw it was no use . So he commenced .  "" Once there was a little Pony Engine that used to play round the  Fitchburg Depot on the side tracks , and sleep in among the big  locomotives in the car - house-- ""  The little girl lifted her head from the papa 's shoulder , where she had  dropped it . "" Is it a sad story , papa ? ""  "" How is it going to end ? "" asked"	1	0
" "" Oh , all right , if it 's got a moral , "" said the children ; they had a good  deal of fun with the morals the papa put to his stories . The boy added ,  "" Go on , "" and the little girl prompted , "" Car - house . ""  The papa said , "" Now every time you stop me I shall have to begin all  over again . "" But he saw that this was not going to spite them any , so he  went on : "" One of the locomotives was its mother , and she had got hurt  once in a big smash - up , so that she could n't run long trips any more .  She was so weak in the chest you could hear her wheeze as far as you  could see her . But she could work round the depot , and pull empty cars  in and out , and shunt them off on the side tracks ; and she was so  anxious to be useful that all the other engines respected her , and they  were very kind to the little Pony Engine on her account , though it was  always getting in the way , and under their wheels , and everything . They  all knew it was an orphan , for before its mother got hurt its father  went through a bridge one dark night into an arm of the sea , and was  never heard of again ; he was supposed to have been drowned . The old  mother locomotive used to say that it would never have happened if she  had been there ; but poor dear No . 236 was always so venturesome , and she  had warned him against that very bridge time and again . Then she would  whistle so dolefully , and sigh with her air - brakes enough to make  anybody cry . You see they used to be a very happy family when they were  all together , before the papa locomotive got drowned . He was very fond  of the little Pony Engine , and told it stories at night after they got  into the car - house , at the end of some of his long runs . It would get up  on his cow - catcher , and lean its chimney up against his , and listen till  it fell asleep . Then he would put it softly down , and be off again in  the morning before it was awake . I tell you , those were happy days for  poor No . 236 . The little Pony Engine could just remember him ; it was  awfully proud of its papa . ""  The boy lifted his head and looked"	1	0
"   I was n't , any such thing ! "" said the little girl . "" And I do n't care !  So ! "" and then she sobbed .  "" Now , never you mind , "" said the papa to the boy . "" You 'll be putting up  _ your _ lip before I 'm through . Well , and then she used to caution the  little Pony Engine against getting in the way of the big locomotives ,  and told it to keep close round after her , and try to do all it could to  learn about shifting empty cars . You see , she knew how ambitious the  little Pony Engine was , and how it was n't contented a bit just to grow  up in the pony - engine business , and be tied down to the depot all its  days . Once she happened to tell it that if it was good and always did  what it was bid , perhaps a cow - catcher would grow on it some day , and  then it could be a passenger locomotive . Mammas have to promise all  sorts of things , and she was almost distracted when she said that . ""  "" I do n't think she ought to have deceived it , papa , "" said the boy . "" But  it ought to have known that if it was a Pony Engine to begin with , it  never could have a cow - catcher . ""  "" Could n't it ? "" asked the little girl , gently .  "" No ; they 're kind of mooley . ""  The little girl asked the papa , "" What makes Pony Engines mooley ? "" for  she did not choose to be told by her brother ; he was only two years  older than she was , anyway .  "" Well ; it 's pretty hard to say . You see , when a locomotive is first  hatched-- ""  "" Oh , are they hatched , papa ? "" asked the boy .  "" Well , we 'll _ call _ it hatched , "" said the papa ; but they knew he was  just funning . "" They 're about the size of tea - kettles at first ; and it 's  a chance whether they will have cow - catchers or not . If they keep their  spouts , they will ; and if their spouts drop off , they wo n't . ""  "" What makes the spout ever drop off ? ""  "" Oh , sometimes the pip , or the gapes-- ""  The children both began to shake the papa , and he was glad enough to go  on sensibly . "" Well"	1	0
"   Do they swear , papa ? "" asked the little girl , somewhat shocked , and yet  pleased .  "" Well , I never heard them , _ near by _ . But it sounds a good deal like  swearing when you hear them on the up - grade on our hill in the night .  Where was I ? ""  "" Swearing , "" said the boy . "" And please do n't go back , now , papa . ""  "" Well , I wo n't . It 'll be as much as I can do to get through this story ,  without going over any of it again . Well , the thing that the little Pony  Engine wanted to be , the most in this world , was the locomotive of the  Pacific Express , that starts out every afternoon at three , you know . It  intended to apply for the place as soon as its cow - catcher was grown ,  and it was always trying to attract the locomotive 's attention , backing  and filling on the track alongside of the train ; and once it raced it a  little piece , and beat it , before the Express locomotive was under way ,  and almost got in front of it on a switch . My , but its mother was  scared ! She just yelled to it with her whistle ; and that night she sent  it to sleep without a particle of coal or water in its tender .  "" But the little Pony Engine did n't care . It had beaten the Pacific  Express in a hundred yards , and what was to hinder it from beating it as  long as it chose ? The little Pony Engine could not get it out of its  head . It was just like a boy who thinks he can whip a man . ""  The boy lifted his head . "" Well , a boy _ can _ , papa , if he goes to do it  the right way . Just stoop down before the man knows it , and catch him by  the legs and tip him right over . ""  "" Ho ! I guess you see yourself ! "" said the little girl , scornfully .  "" Well , I _ could _ ! "" said the boy ; "" and some day I 'll just show you . ""  "" Now , little cock - sparrow , now ! "" said the papa ; and he laughed . "" Well ,  the little Pony Engine thought he could beat the Pacific Express ,  anyway ; and so one dark , snowy , blowy afternoon , when his mother was off  pushing some empty coal cars"	1	0
"Of course the Express locomotive was  drawing a heavy train of cars , and it had to make a stop or two -- at  Charlestown , and at Concord Junction , and at Ayer -- so the Pony Engine  did really gain on it a little ; and when it began to be scared it gained  a good deal . But the first place where it began to feel sorry , and to  want its mother , was in Hoosac Tunnel . It never was in a tunnel before ,  and it seemed as if it would never get out . It kept thinking , What if  the Pacific Express was to run over it there in the dark , and its mother  off there at the Fitchburg Depot , in Boston , looking for it among the  side - tracks ? It gave a perfect shriek ; and just then it shot out of the  tunnel . There were a lot of locomotives loafing around there at North  Adams , and one of them shouted out to it as it flew by , ' What 's your  hurry , little one ? ' and it just screamed back , ' Pacific Express ! ' and  never stopped to explain . They talked in locomotive language-- ""  "" Oh , what did it sound like ? "" the boy asked .  "" Well , pretty queer ; I 'll tell you some day . It knew it had no time to  fool away , and all through the long , dark night , whenever , a locomotive  hailed it , it just screamed , ' Pacific Express ! ' and kept on . And the  Express kept gaining on it . Some of the locomotives wanted to stop it ,  but they decided they had better not get in its way , and so it whizzed  along across New York State and Ohio and Indiana , till it got to  Chicago . And the Express kept gaining on it . By that time it was so  hoarse it could hardly whisper , but it kept saying , ' Pacific Express !  Pacific Express ! ' and it kept right on till it reached the Mississippi  River . There it found a long train of freight cars before it on the  bridge . It could n't wait , and so it slipped down from the track to the  edge of the river and jumped across , and then scrambled up the  embankment to the track again . ""  "" Papa ! "" said the little girl , warningly .  "" Truly it did , "" said the papa .  "" Ho ! that 's nothing , "" said the boy . "" A whole train of cars did it in "	1	0
"There was a kind old  locomotive at Omaha that tried to find out where it belonged , and what  its mother 's name was , but the Pony Engine was so bewildered it could n't  tell . And the Express kept gaining on it . On the plains it was chased by  a pack of prairie wolves , but it left them far behind ; and the antelopes  were scared half to death . But the worst of it was when the nightmare  got after it . ""  "" The nightmare ? Goodness ! "" said the boy .  "" I 've had the nightmare , "" said the little girl .  "" Oh yes , a mere human nightmare , "" said the papa . "" But a locomotive  nightmare is a very different thing . ""  "" Why , what 's it like ? "" asked the boy . The little girl was almost afraid  to ask .  "" Well , it has only one leg , to begin with . ""  "" Pshaw ! ""  "" Wheel , I mean . And it has four cow - catchers , and four head - lights , and  two boilers , and eight whistles , and it just goes whirling and  screeching along . Of course it wobbles awfully ; and as it 's only got one  wheel , it has to keep skipping from one track to the other . ""  "" I should think it would run on the cross - ties , "" said the boy .  "" Oh , very well , then ! "" said the papa . "" If you know so much more about it  than I do ! Who 's telling this story , anyway ? Now I shall have to go back  to the beginning . Once there was a little Pony En-- ""  They both put their hands over his mouth , and just fairly begged him to  go on , and at last he did . "" Well , it got away from the nightmare about  morning , but not till the nightmare had bitten a large piece out of its  tender , and then it braced up for the home - stretch . It thought that if  it could once beat the Express to the Sierras , it could keep the start  the rest of the way , for it could get over the mountains quicker than  the Express could , and it might be in San Francisco before the Express  got to Sacramento . The Express kept gaining on it . But it just zipped  along the upper edge of Kansas and the lower edge of Nebraska , and on  through Colorado and Utah and Nevada , and when it got to the Sierras"	1	0
"It just said ' Express ! Express ! ' and then  ' ' Press ! ' Press ! ' and then ' ' Ess ! ' Ess ! ' and pretty soon only ' ' Ss !  ' Ss ! ' And the Express kept gaining on it . Before they reached San  Francisco , the Express locomotive 's cow - catcher was almost touching the  Pony Engine 's tender ; it gave one howl of anguish as it felt the Express  locomotive 's hot breath on the place where the nightmare had bitten the  piece out , and tore through the end of the San Francisco depot , and  plunged into the Pacific Ocean , and was never seen again . There , now , ""  said the papa , trying to make the children get down , "" that 's all . Go to  bed . "" The little girl was crying , and so he tried to comfort her by  keeping her in his lap .  The boy cleared his throat . "" What is the moral , papa ? "" he asked ,  huskily .  "" Children , obey your parents , "" said the papa .  "" And what became of the mother locomotive ? "" pursued the boy .  "" She had a brain - fever , and never quite recovered the use of her mind  again . ""  The boy thought awhile . "" Well , I do n't see what it had to do with  Christmas , anyway . ""  "" Why , it was Christmas Eve when the Pony Engine started from Boston , and  Christmas afternoon when it reached San Francisco . ""  "" Ho ! "" said the boy . "" No locomotive could get across the continent in a  day and a night , let alone a little Pony Engine . ""  "" But this Pony Engine _ had _ to . Did you never hear of the beaver that  clomb the tree ? ""  "" No ! Tell-- ""  "" Yes , some other time . ""  "" But how _ could _ it get across so quick ? Just one day ! ""  "" Well , perhaps it was a year . Maybe it was the _ next _ Christmas after  that when it got to San Francisco . ""  The papa set the little girl down , and started to run out of the room ,  and both of the children ran after him , to pound him .  When they were in bed the boy called down - stairs to the papa , "" Well ,  anyway , I did n't put up my lip . ""  THE PUMPKIN - GLORY  The papa had told the story so often"	1	0
" Sometimes he would go wrong on purpose , or would pretend to forget , and  then they had a perfect right to pound him till he quit it . He usually  quit pretty soon .  The children liked it because it was very exciting , and at the same time  it had no moral , so that when it was all over , they could feel that they  had not been excited just for the moral . The first time the little girl  heard it she began to cry , when it came to the worst part ; but the boy  had heard it so much by that time that he did not mind it in the least ,  and just laughed .  The story was in season any time between Thanksgiving and New Years ; but  the papa usually began to tell it in the early part of October , when the  farmers were getting in their pumpkins , and the children were asking  when they were going to have any squash pies , and the boy had made his  first jack - o'-lantern .  "" Well , "" the papa said , "" once there were two little pumpkin seeds , and  one was a good little pumpkin seed , and the other was bad -- very proud ,  and vain , and ambitious . ""  The papa had told them what ambitious was , and so the children did not  stop him when he came to that word ; but sometimes he would stop of his  own accord , and then if they could not tell what it meant , he would  pretend that he was not going on ; but he always did go on .  "" Well , the farmer took both the seeds out to plant them in the  home - patch , because they were a very extra kind of seeds , and he was not  going to risk them in the cornfield , among the corn . So before he put  them in the ground , he asked each one of them what he wanted to be when  he came up , and the good little pumpkin seed said he wanted to come up a  pumpkin , and be made into a pie , and be eaten at Thanksgiving dinner ;  and the bad little pumpkin seed said he wanted to come up a  morning - glory .  "" ' Morning - glory ! ' says the farmer . ' I guess you 'll come up a  pumpkin - glory , first thing _ you _ know , ' and then he haw - hawed , and told  his son , who was helping him to plant the garden , to keep watch of that  particular hill of pumpkins"	1	0
" "" But the two little pumpkin seeds , they knew where they were well  enough , and they lay low , and let the rain and the sun soak in and swell  them up ; and then they both began to push , and by - and - by they got their  heads out of the ground , with their shells down over their eyes like  caps , and as soon as they could shake them off and look round , the bad  little pumpkin vine said to his brother :  "" ' Well , what are you going to do now ? '  "" The good little pumpkin vine said , ' Oh , I 'm just going to stay here ,  and grow and grow , and put out all the blossoms I can , and let them all  drop off but one , and then grow that into the biggest and fattest and  sweetest pumpkin that ever was for Thanksgiving pies . '  "" ' Well , that 's what I am going to do , too , ' said the bad little pumpkin  vine , ' all but the pies ; but I 'm not going to stay here to do it . I 'm  going to that fence over there , where the morning - glories were last  summer , and I 'm going to show them what a pumpkin - glory is like . I 'm  just going to cover myself with blossoms ; and blossoms that wo n't shut  up , either , when the sun comes out , but 'll stay open , as if they had n't  anything to be ashamed of , and that wo n't drop off the first day ,  either . I noticed those morning - glories all last summer , when I was  nothing but one of the blossoms myself , and I just made up my mind that  as soon as ever I got to be a vine , I would show them a thing or two .  Maybe I _ ca n't _ be a morning - glory , but I can be a pumpkin - glory , and I  guess that 's glory enough . '  "" It made the cold chills run over the good little vine to hear its  brother talk like that , and it begged him not to do it ; and it began to  cry--  "" What 's that ? "" The papa stopped short , and the boy stopped whispering in  his sister 's ear , and she answered :  "" He said he bet it was a girl ! "" The tears stood in her eyes , and the boy  said :  "" Well , anyway , it was _ like _ a girl ."	1	0
" "" The farmer was pretty busy that summer , and after the first two or  three hoeings he had to leave the two pumpkin vines to the boy that had  helped him to plant the seed , and the boy had to go fishing so much , and  then in swimming , that he perfectly neglected them , and let them run  wild , if they wanted to ; and if the good little pumpkin vine had not  been the best little pumpkin vine that ever was , it _ would _ have run  wild . But it just stayed where it was , and thickened up , and covered  itself with blossoms , till it was like one mass of gold . It was very  fond of all its blossoms , and it could n't bear hardly to think of losing  any of them ; but it knew they could n't every one grow up to be a very  large pumpkin , and so it let them gradually drop off till it only had  one left , and then it just gave all its attention to that one , and did  everything it could to make it grow into the kind of pumpkin it said it  would .  "" All this time the bad little pumpkin vine was carrying out its plan of  being a pumpkin - glory . In the first place it found out that if it  expected to get through by fall it could n't fool much putting out a lot  of blossoms and waiting for them to drop off , before it began to devote  itself to business . The fence was a good piece off , and it had to reach  the fence in the first place , for there would n't be any fun in being a  pumpkin - glory down where nobody could see you , or anything . So the bad  little pumpkin vine began to pull and stretch towards the fence , and  sometimes it thought it would surely snap in two , it pulled and  stretched so hard . But besides the pulling and stretching , it had to  hide , and go round , because if it had been seen it would n't have been  allowed to go to the fence . It was a good thing there were so many  weeds , that the boy was too lazy to pull up , and the bad little pumpkin  vine could hide among . But then they were a good deal of a hinderance ,  too , because they were so thick it could hardly get through them . It had  to pass some rows of pease that were perfectly awful ; they tied  themselves to it and tried to keep it back ; and there was one"	1	0
"It was all pulled out so thin that it was n't any thicker than a  piece of twine in some places , and its leaves just hung in tatters . It  had n't had time to put out more than one blossom , and that was such a  poor little sickly thing that it could hardly hang on . The question was ,  How can a pumpkin vine climb a fence , anyway ?  "" Its knees and elbows were all worn to strings getting there , or that 's  what the pumpkin thought , till it wound one of those tendrils round a  splinter of the fence , without thinking , and happened to pull , and then  it was perfectly surprised to find that it seemed to lift itself off the  ground a little . It said to itself , ' Let 's try a few more , ' and it  twisted some more of the tendrils round some more splinters , and this  time it fairly lifted itself off the ground . It said , ' Ah , I see ! ' as if  it had somehow expected to do something of the kind all along ; but it  had to be pretty careful getting up the fence not to knock its blossom  off , for that would have been the end of it ; and when it did get up  among the morning - glories it almost killed the poor thing , keeping it  open night and day , and showing it off in the hottest sun , and not  giving it a bit of shade , but just holding it out where it could be seen  the whole time . It was n't very much of a blossom compared with the  blossoms on the good little pumpkin vine , but it was bigger than any of  the morning - glories , and that was some satisfaction , and the bad little  pumpkin vine was as proud as if it was the largest blossom in the world .  "" When the blossom 's leaves dropped off , and a little pumpkin began to  grow on in its place , the vine did everything it could for it ; just gave  itself up to it , and put all its strength into it . After all , it was a  pretty queer - looking pumpkin , though . It had to grow hanging down , and  not resting on anything , and after it started with a round head , like  other pumpkins , its neck began to pull out , and pull out , till it looked  like a gourd or a big pear . That 's the way it looked in the fall ,  hanging from the vine on the fence , when the first light"	1	0
"He was perfectly astonished to see the size of the  good little pumpkin ; you could hardly get it into a bushel basket , and  he gathered it , and sent it to the county fair , and took the first  premium with it . ""  "" How much was the premium ? "" asked the boy . He yawned ; he had heard all  these facts so often before .  "" It was fifty cents ; but you see the farmer had to pay two dollars to  get a chance to try for the premium at the fair ; and so it was _ some _  satisfaction . Anyway , he took the premium , and he tried to sell the  pumpkin , and when he could n't , he brought it home and told his wife they  must have it for Thanksgiving . The boy had gathered the bad little  pumpkin , and kept it from being fed to the cow , it was so funny - looking ;  and the day before Thanksgiving the farmer found it in the barn , and he  said ,  "" ' Hollo ! Here 's that little fool pumpkin . Wonder if it thinks it 's a  morning - glory yet ? '  "" And the boy said , ' Oh , father , may n't I have it ? '  "" And the father said , ' Guess so . What are you going to do with it ? '  "" But the boy did n't tell , because he was going to keep it for a  surprise ; but as soon as his father went out of the barn , he picked up  the bad little pumpkin by its long neck , and he kind of balanced it  before him , and he said , ' Well , now , I 'm going to make a pumpkin - glory  out of _ you _ ! '  "" And when the bad little pumpkin heard that , all its seeds fairly  rattled in it for joy . The boy took out his knife , and the first thing  the pumpkin knew he was cutting a kind of lid off the top of it ; it was  like getting scalped , but the pumpkin did n't mind it , because it was  just the same as war . And when the boy got the top off he poured the  seeds out , and began to scrape the inside as thin as he could without  breaking through . It hurt awfully , and nothing but the hope of being a  pumpkin - glory could have kept the little pumpkin quiet ; but it did n't  say a word , even after the boy had made a mouth for it , with"	1	0
" And the papa twisted his mouth , and winked with one eye , and wrinkled  his nose till the little girl begged him to stop . Then he went on :  "" The boy hid the bad pumpkin behind him till his mother was gone ,  because he did n't want her in the secret ; and then he slipped into the  house , and put it under his bed . It was pretty lonesome up there in the  boy 's room -- he slept in the garret , and there was nothing but broken  furniture besides his bed ; but all day long it could smell the good  little pumpkin , boiling and boiling for pies ; and late at night , after  the boy had gone to sleep , it could smell the hot pies when they came  out of the oven . They smelt splendid , but the bad little pumpkin did n't  envy them a bit ; it just said , ' Pooh ! What 's twenty pumpkin pies to one  pumpkin - glory ? ' ""  "" It ought to have said ' what _ are _ , ' ought n't it , papa ? "" asked the  little girl .  "" It certainly ought , "" said the papa . "" But if nothing but it 's grammar  had been bad , there would n't have been much to complain of about it . ""  "" I do n't suppose it had ever heard much good grammar from the farmer 's  family , "" suggested the boy . "" Farmers always say cowcumbers instead of  cucumbers . ""  "" Oh , _ do _ tell us about the Cowcumber , and the Bullcumber , and the  little Calfcumbers , papa ! "" the little girl entreated , and she clasped  her hands , to show how anxious she was .  "" What ! And leave off at the most exciting part of the pumpkin - glory ? ""  The little girl saw what a mistake she had made ; the boy just gave her  _ one look _ , and she cowered down into the papa 's lap , and the papa went  on .  "" Well , they had an extra big Thanksgiving at the farmer 's that day . Lots  of the relations came from out West ; the grandmother , who was living  with the farmer , was getting pretty old , and every year or two she  thought she was n't going to live very much longer , and she wrote to the  relations in Wisconsin , and everywhere , that if they expected to see her  alive again , they had better come this time , and bring all their  families . She kept doing it"	1	0
"They had to sleep on the floor , a  good many of them , and you could hardly step for them ; the boys slept in  the barn , and they laughed and cut up so the whole night that the  roosters thought it was morning , and kept crowing till they made their  throats sore , and had to wear wet compresses round them every night for  a week afterwards . ""  When the papa said anything like this the children had a right to pound  him , but they were so anxious not to have him stop , that this time they  did not do it . They said , "" Go on , go on ! "" and the little girl said , "" And  then the tables ! ""  "" Tables ? Well , I should think so ! They got all the tables there were in  the house , up stairs and down , for dinner Thanksgiving Day , and they  took the grandmother 's work - stand and put it at the head , and she sat  down there ; only she was so used to knitting by that table that she kept  looking for her knitting - needles all through dinner , and could n't seem  to remember what it was she was missing . The other end of the table was  the carpenter 's bench that they brought in out of the barn , and they put  the youngest and funniest papa at that . The tables stretched from the  kitchen into the dining - room , and clear through that out into the hall ,  and across into the parlor . They had n't table - cloths enough to go the  whole length , and the end of the carpenter 's bench , where the funniest  papa sat , was bare , and all through dinner - time he kept making fun . The  vise was right at the corner , and when he got his help of turkey , he  pretended that it was so tough he had to fasten the bone in the vise ,  and cut the meat off with his knife like a draw - shave . ""  "" It was the drumstick , I suppose , papa ? "" said the boy . "" A turkey 's  drumstick is all full of little wooden splinters , anyway . ""  "" And what did the mamma say ? "" asked the little girl .  "" Oh , she kept saying , ' Now you behave ! ' and , ' Well , I should think you 'd  be ashamed !

"Only he began to  slip when he was coming down the roof , and he 'd have slipped clear off  if he had n't caught his trousers on a shingle - nail , and stuck . It made a  pretty bad tear , but the other boys pinned it up so that it would n't  show , and the pumpkin - glory was n't hurt a bit . They all said that it was  about the best jack - o'-lantern they almost ever saw , on account of the  long neck there was to it ; and they made a plan to stick the end of the  neck into the top of the pump , and have fun hearing what the folks would  say when they came out after dark and saw it all lit up ; and then they  noticed the pigpen at the corner of the barn , and began to plague the  pig , and so many of them got up on the pen that they broke the middle  board off ; and they did n't like to nail it on again because it was  Thanksgiving Day , and you must n't hammer or anything ; so they just stuck  it up in its place with a piece of wood against it , and the boy said he  would fix it in the morning .  "" The grown folks stayed so long at the table that it was nearly dark  when the boys got to it , and they would have been almost starved if the  farm - boy had n't brought out apples and doughnuts every little while . As  it was , they were pretty hungry , and they began on the pumpkin pie at  once , so as to keep eating till the mother and the other mothers that  were helping could get some of the things out of the oven that they had  been keeping hot for the boys . The pie was so nice that they kept eating  at it all along , and the mother told them about the good little pumpkin  that it was made of , and how the good little pumpkin had never had any  wish from the time it was nothing but a seed , except to grow up and be  made into pies and eaten at Thanksgiving ; and they must all try to be  good , too , and grow up and do likewise . The boys did n't say anything ,  because their mouths were so full , but they looked at each other and  winked their left eyes . There were about forty or fifty of them , and  when they all winked their left eyes it made it so dark you could hardly  see ; and the mother got the lamp ;"	1	0
" "" I ca n't show how fifty boys looked , "" said the papa . "" But they looked a  good deal like the pumpkin - glory that was waiting quietly in the barn  for them to get through , and come out and have some fun with it . When  they had all eaten so much that they could hardly stand up , they got  down from the table , and grabbed their hats , and started for the door .  But they had to go out the back way , because the table took up the  front entry , and that gave the farmer 's boy a chance to find a piece of  candle out in the kitchen and some matches ; and then they rushed to the  barn . It was so dark there already that they thought they had better  light up the pumpkin - glory and try it . They lit it up , and it worked  splendidly ; but they forgot to put out the match , and it caught some  straw on the barn floor , and a little more and it would have burnt the  barn down . The boys stamped the fire out in about half a second ; and  after that they waited till it was dark outside before they lit up the  pumpkin - glory again . Then they all bent down over it to keep the wind  from blowing the match anywhere , and pretty soon it was lit up , and the  farmer 's boy took the pumpkin - glory by its long neck , and stuck the  point in the hole in the top of the pump ; and just then the funniest  papa came round the corner of the wood - house , and said :  "" ' What have you got there , boys ? Jack - o'-lantern ? Well , well . That 's a  good one ! '  "" He came up and looked at the pumpkin - glory , and he bent back and he  bent forward , and he doubled down and he straightened up , and laughed  till the boys thought he was going to kill himself .  "" They had all intended to burst into an Indian yell , and dance round the  pumpkin - glory ; but the funniest papa said , ' Now all you fellows keep  still half a minute , ' and the next thing they knew he ran into the  house , and came out , walking his wife before him with both his hands  over her eyes . Then the boys saw he was going to have some fun with her ,  and they kept as still as mice , and waited till he walked her up to the  pumpkin -"	1	0
"It 's just gramma 's kind of joke , ' and then  the mothers all got round him and said he should n't fool the  grandmother , anyway ; and he said he was n't going to : he was just going  to bring her out and let her see it ; and his wife went along with him to  watch that he did n't begin acting up .  "" The grandmother had been sitting all alone in her room ever since  dinner ; because she was always afraid somehow that if you enjoyed  yourself it was a sign you were going to suffer for it , and she had  enjoyed herself a good deal that day , and she was feeling awfully about  it .

All the time she kept putting on her things for her , and  the grandmother seemed to get quite in the notion , and she laughed a  little , and they thought she was going to enjoy it as much as anybody ;  they really did , because they were all very tender of her , and they  would n't have scared her for anything , and everybody kept cheering her  up and telling her how much they knew she would like it , till they got  her to the pump . The little pumpkin - glory was feeling awfully proud and  self - satisfied ; for it had never seen any flower or any vegetable  treated with half so much honor by human beings . It was n't sure at first  that it was very nice to be laughed at so much , but after a while it  began to conclude that the papas and the mammas were just laughing"	1	0
" Anyway , it tried to give a very broad grin , and all of a sudden it split  its mouth from ear to ear . ""  "" You did n't say it had any ears before , "" said the boy .  "" No ; it had them behind , "" said the papa ; and the boy felt like giving  him just one pound ; but he thought it might stop the story , and so he  let the papa go on .  "" As soon as the grandmother saw it open its mouth that way she just gave  one scream , ' My sakes ! It 's comin ' to life !

As it was ,  they piled round her , and kept her up ; but there were so many of them  they jostled the pump , and the first thing the pumpkin - glory knew , it  fell down and burst open ; and the pig that the boys had plagued , and  that had kept squealing all the time because it thought that the people  had come out to feed it , knocked the loose board off its pen , and flew  out and gobbled the pumpkin - glory up , candle and all , and that was the  end of the proud little pumpkin - glory . ""  "" And when the pig ate the candle it looked like the magician when he  puts burning tow in his mouth , "" said the boy .  "" Exactly , "" said the papa .

"He  pretended to be asleep , and even when they grabbed hold of him and shook  him , he just let his teeth clatter , and made no sign of waking up . But  they knew he was fooling , and they kept shaking him till he opened his  eyes and looked round , and said , "" Oh , oh ! where am I ? "" as if he were all  bewildered .  "" You 're in bed with _ us _ ! "" they shouted ; and they acted as if they were  afraid he would try to get away from them by the way they held on to  his arms .  But he lay quite still , and he only said , "" I should say _ you _ were in  bed with _ me _ . It seems to be my bed . ""  "" It 's the same thing ! "" said the nephew .  "" How do you make that out ? "" asked the papa . "" It 's the same thing if it 's  enchantment . But if it is n't , it is n't . ""  The niece said , "" What enchantment ? "" for she thought that would be a  pretty good chance to get what they had come for .  She was perfectly delighted , and gave a joyful thrill all over when the  papa said , "" Oh , that 's a long story . ""  "" Well , the longer the better , _ I _ should say ; should n't you , brother ? ""  she returned .  The nephew hemmed twice in his throat , and asked , drowsily , "" Is it a  little - pig story , or a fairy - prince story ?

"As soon as they stopped , he  opened his eyes .  "" Now do n't say , ' Where am I ? ' "" said the niece .  The papa could not help laughing , because that was just the very thing  he was going to say . "" Well , all right ! What about that story ? Do you  want to hear it , and take your chances of its being a Prince to the  end ? ""  "" I suppose we 'll have to ; wo n't we , sister ? ""  "" Yes , we 'll leave it all to you , uncle , "" said the niece ; and she thought  she would coax him up a little , and so she went on : "" I know you wo n't be  mean about it . Will he , brother ? ""  "" No , "" said the nephew . "" I 'll bet the Prince will keep a Prince all the  way through . What 'll _ you _ bet , sister ? ""  "" I wo n't bet anything , "" said the niece , and she put her arm round the  papa 's neck , and pressed her cheek up against his . "" I 'll just leave it  to uncle , and if it _ does _ turn into a little - pig story , it 'll be for  the moral . ""  The nephew was not quite sure what a moral was ; but at the bottom of his  heart he would just as soon have it a little - pig story as not . He had  got to thinking how funny a little pig would look in a Prince 's clothes ,  and he said , "" Yes , it 'll be for the moral . ""  The papa was very contrary that morning . "" Well , "" said he , "" I do n't know  about that . I 'm not sure there 's going to be any moral . ""  "" Oh , goody ! "" said the niece , and she clapped her hands in great delight .  "" Then it 's going to be a Prince story all through ! ""  "" If you interrupt me in that way , it 's not going to be any story at  all . ""  "" I did n't know you had begun it , uncle , "" pleaded the niece .  "" Well , I had n't . But I was just going to . "" The papa lay quiet a while .  The fact is , he had not thought up any story at all ; and he was so tired  of all the stories he used to tell his own children that he could"	1	0
"It 's about a Prince and a Princess . ""  "" Oh ! "" went both of the children ; and then they stopped themselves , and  stuffed the covering into their mouths .  The papa lifted himself on his elbow and stared severely at them , first  at one , and then at the other . "" Have you finished ? "" he asked , as if  they had interrupted him ; but he really wanted to gain time , so as to  think up a story of some kind . The children were afraid to say anything ,  and the papa went on with freezing politeness : "" Because if you have , I  might like to say something myself . This story is about a Prince and a  Princess , but the thing of it is that they had names almost exactly  alike . They were twins ; the Prince was a boy and the Princess was a  girl ; that was a point that their fairy godmother carried against the  wicked enchantress who tried to have it just the other way ; but it made  the wicked enchantress so mad that the fairy godmother had to give in to  her a little , and let them be named almost exactly alike . ""  Here the papa stopped , and after waiting for him to go on , the nephew  ventured to ask , very respectfully indeed , "" Would you mind telling us  what their names were , uncle ? ""  The papa rubbed his forehead . "" I have such a bad memory for names . Hold  on ! Wait a minute ! I remember now ! Their names were Butterflyflutterby  and Flutterbybutterfly . "" Of course he had just thought up the names .  "" And which was which , uncle dear ? "" asked the niece , not only very  respectfully , but very affectionately , too ; she was so afraid he would  get mad again , and stop altogether .  "" Why , I should think you would know a girl 's name when you heard it .  Butterflyflutterby was the Prince and Flutterbybutterfly was the  Princess . ""  "" I do n't see how we 're ever going to keep them apart , "" sighed the niece .  "" You 've _ got _ to keep them apart , "" said the papa . "" Because it 's the  great thing about the story that if you ca n't remember which is the  Prince and which is the Princess whenever I ask you , the story has to  stop . It ca n't help it , and _ I _ ca n't help it . ""  They knew he was just setting a trap for them , and"	1	0
"  They dropped back and pulled the covering up to their chins , and  shouted ,  Do n't you tell ! do n't you tell ! "" and just perfectly wriggled  with triumph .  The papa had heard every word ; they were laughing so that they whispered  almost as loud as talking ; but he pretended that he had not understood ,  and he made up his mind that he would have them yet . "" A little and a  more , "" he said , "" and I should never have gone on again . ""  "" Go on ! Go on ! "" they called out , and then they wriggled and giggled  till anybody would have thought they were both crazy .  "" Well , where was I ? "" This was another of the papa 's tricks to gain time .  Whenever he could not think of anything more , he always asked , "" Well ,  where was I ? "" He now added : "" Oh yes ! I remember ! Well , once there were a  Prince and a Princess , and their names were Butterflyflutterby and  Flutterbybutterfly ; and they were both twins , and both orphans ; but they  made their home with their fairy godmother as long as they were little ,  and they used to help her about the house for part board , and she helped  them about their kingdom , and kept it in good order for them , and left  them plenty of time to play and enjoy themselves . She was the greatest  person for order there ever was ; and if she found a speck of dust or  dirt on the kingdom anywhere , she would have out the whole army and make  them wash it up , and then sand - paper the place , and polish it with a  coarse towel till it perfectly glistened . The father of the Prince and  Princess had taken the precaution , before he died , to subdue all his  enemies ; and the consequence was that the longest kind of peace had set  in , and the army had nothing to do but keep the kingdom clean . That was  the reason why the fairy godmother had made the General - in - Chief take  their guns away , and arm them with long feather - dusters . They marched  with the poles on their shoulders , and carried the dusters in their  belts , like bayonets ; and whenever they came to a place that the fairy  godmother said needed dusting -- she always went along with them in a  diamond chariot -- she made the General halloo out : ' Fix dusters ! Make  ready ! Aim ! Dust"	1	0
"Still he did what the fairy godmother told  him , because he said it was his duty ; and he kept his troops supplied  with sudsine and dustene , to clean up with , and brushes and towels . The  fairy godmother-- ""  "" Excuse me , uncle , "" said the nephew , with extreme deference , "" but I  should just like to ask you one question . Will you let me ? ""  "" What is it ? "" said the papa , in the grimmest kind of manner he could put  on .  "" Ah , brother ! "" murmured the niece ; for she knew that he was rather  sarcastic , and she was afraid that something ironical was coming .  "" Well , I just wanted to ask whether this story was about the fairy  godmother , or about the Prince and Princess . ""  "" Very well , now , "" said the papa . "" You 've asked your question . I did n't  promise to answer it , and I 'm happy to say it stops the story . I 'll  guess _ I 'll _ go to sleep again . I do n't like being waked up this way in  the middle of the night , anyhow . ""  "" Now , brother , I hope you 're satisfied ! "" said the niece .  The nephew evaded the point . He said : "" Well , sister , if the story really  is n't going on , I should like to ask uncle another question . How big was  the fairy godmother 's diamond chariot ? ""  "" It was the usual sized chariot , "" answered the papa .  "" Whew ! It must have been a pretty big diamond , then ! ""  "" It was a _ very _ big diamond , "" said the papa ; and he seemed to forget  all about being mad , or else he had thought up some more of the story  to tell , for he went on just as if nothing had happened . "" The fairy  godmother was so severe with the dirt she found because it was a royal  prerogative -- that is , nobody but the King , or the King 's family , had a  right to make a mess , and if other people did it , they were infringing  on the royal prerogative .  "" You know , "" the papa explained , "" that in old times and countries the  royal family have been allowed to do things that no other family would  have been associated with if they had done them . That is about the only  use there is in having a royal family . But the"	1	0
" "" Correct , "" said the papa .  The children rose up into a capital A again , and whispered , "" He did n't  catch us _ that _ time , "" and fell back , laughing , and the papa had to go  on .  "" The fairy godmother thought she would try to bring up the Prince and  Princess rather better than most Princes and Princesses were brought up ,  and so she said that the only thing they should be allowed to do  different from other people was to make a mess . If any other persons  were caught making a mess they were banished ; and there was another law  that was perfectly awful . ""  "" What - was - it - go - ahead ? "" said the nephew , running all his words together ,  he was so anxious to know .  "" Why , if any person was found clearing up anywhere , and it turned out to  be a mess that the royal twins had made , the person was thrown from a  tower . ""  "" Did it kill them ? "" the niece inquired , rather faintly .  "" Well , no , it did n't _ kill _ them exactly , but it bounced them up pretty  high . You see , they fell on a bed of India - rubber about twenty feet  deep . It gave them a good scare ; and that 's the great thing in throwing  persons from a high tower . ""  The nephew hastened to improve the opportunity which seemed to be given  for asking questions .  "" What do you mean exactly by making a mess , uncle ? ""  "" Oh , scattering scraps of paper about , or scuffing the landscape , or  getting jam or molasses on the face of nature , or having bonfires in the  back yard of the palace , or leaving dolls around on the throne . But what  did I say about asking questions ? Now there 's another thing about this  story : when it comes to the exciting part , if you move the least bit , or  even breathe loud , the story stops , just as if you did n't know which was  the Prince and which was the Princess . _ Now _ do you understand ? ""  The children both said "" Yes "" in a very small whisper , and cowered down  almost under the clothing , and held on tight , so as to keep from  stirring .  The papa went on : "" Well , about the time they had got these two laws in  full force , and forty or fifty thousand boys and girls had"	1	0
"It also happened that the Khan and the Khant were brother and  sister ; but if you ca n't tell which was the brother and which was the  sister , the story stops at this point . ""  "" Why , but , uncle , "" said the little girl , reproachfully , "" you have n't  ever told us which is which yourself yet ! ""  "" I know it . Because I 'm waiting to find out . You see , with these Asiatic  names it 's impossible sometimes to tell which is which . You have to wait  and see how they will act . If there had been a battle anywhere , and one  of them had screamed , and run away , then I suppose I should have been  pretty sure it was the sister ; but even then I should n't know which was  the Khan and which was the Khant . ""  "" Well , what are we going to do about it , then ? "" asked the nephew .  "" I do n't know , "" said the papa . "" We shall just have to keep on and see .  Perhaps when they meet the Prince and Princess we shall find out . I  do n't suppose a boy would fall in love with a boy . ""  "" No , "" said the niece ; "" but he might want to go off with him and have  fun , or something . ""  "" That 's true , "" said the papa . "" We 've got to all watch out . Of course the  Khan and the Khant scuffed the landscape awfully , as they came along  through the kingdom , and got the face of nature all daubed up with  marmalade -- they were the greatest persons for marmalade -- and when they  reached the palace of the Prince and Princess they had to camp out in  the back yard , and they had to have bonfires to cook by , and they made a  frightful mess .  "" Well , there was the greatest excitement about it that there ever was .  The General - in - Chief kept his men under arms night and day , and the  fairy godmother was so worked up she almost had a brain - fever ; and if  she had not taken six of aconite every night when she went to bed she  _ would _ have had . You see , the question was what to do about the mess  that the Khan and Khant made . They were visitors , and it would n't have  been polite to banish them ; and they belonged to a royal family , and so  nobody dared to clean up"	1	0
" "" Well , it kept on going from bad to worse . The only person that enjoyed  herself was the wicked enchantress ; _ she _ never had such a good time in  her life ; and when the fairy godmother got hold of the Grand Vizier and  the Cadi , and told them to make a new law so as to allow the army to  clean up after royal visitors , without being thrown from a high tower ,  the wicked enchantress enchanted the whole mess , so that the army could  not tell which the Prince and Princess had made , and which the Khan and  Khant had made ; they were all four always playing together , anyway .  "" It seemed as if the poor old fairy godmother would go perfectly wild ,  and she almost made the General crazy giving orders in one breath , and  taking them back in the next . She said that now something had got to be  done ; she had stood it long enough ; and she was going to take the case  into her own hands . She saw that she should have no peace of her life  till the Prince and Princess and the Khan and Khant were married . She  sent for the head Imam , and told him to bring those children right in  and marry them , and she would be responsible .  "" The Imam put his head to the floor -- and it was pretty hard on him , for  he was short and stout , and he had to do it kind of sideways -- and said  to hear was to obey ; but he could not marry them unless he knew which  was which .  "" The fairy godmother screamed out : ' I do n't _ care _ which is which ! Marry  them all , just as they are ! '  "" But when she came to think it over , she saw that this would not do , and  so she tried to invent some way out of the trouble . One morning she woke  up with a splendid idea , and she could hardly wait to have breakfast  before she sent for the General - in - Chief . Her nerves were all gone , and  as soon as she saw him , she yelled at him : ' A sham battle -- to - day -- now -- this  very instant ! Right away , right away , right away ! '  "" The General got her to explain herself , and then he understood that she  wanted him to have a grand review and sham battle of all the troops , in  honor of the Khan and Khant ; and the whole court"	1	0
"So the only thing he could do was  to set all the gnomes at work making guns and cannon and powder , and  about twelve o'clock they had them ready , and just after lunch the sham  battle began .  "" The troops marched and counter - marched , and fired away the whole  afternoon , and sprang mines and blew up magazines , and threw cannon  crackers and cannon torpedoes . There was such an awful din and racket  that you could n't hear yourself think , and some of the court ladies were  made perfectly sick by it . They all asked to be excused , but the fairy  godmother would n't excuse one of them . She just kept them there on the  seats round the battle - field , and let them shriek themselves hoarse . So  many of them fainted that they had to have the garden hose brought , and  they kept it sprinkling away on their faces all the afternoon .  "" But it was a failure as far as the Khan and the Khant were concerned .  The fairy godmother expected that as soon as the loudest firing began ,  the girl , whichever it was , would scream , and so they would know  which was which . But the Khan and Khant 's father had been a famous  warrior , and he had been in the habit of taking his children to battle  with him from their earliest years , partly because his wife was dead and  he did n't dare trust them with the careless nurse at home , and partly  because he wanted to harden their nerves . So now they just clapped their  hands , and enjoyed the sham battle down to the ground .  "" About sunset the fairy godmother gave it up . She had to , anyway . The  troops had shot away all their powder , and the gnomes could n't make any  more till the next day . So she set out to return to the city , with all  the court following her diamond chariot , and I can tell you she felt  pretty gloomy . She told the Grand Vizier that now she did n't see any end  to the trouble , and she was just going into hysterics when a barefooted  boy came along driving his cow home from the pasture . The fairy  godmother did n't mind it much , for she was in her chariot ; but the court  ladies were on foot , and they began to scream , ' Oh , the cow ! the cow ! '  and to take hold of the knights , and to get on to the fence , till it was  perfectly packed with them ; and"	1	0

"Yet its connection with      our American festival is obvious . Every one who likes      fairy tales will enjoy reading it .  THE country of the Greedy , well known in history , was ruled by a king  who had much trouble . His subjects were well behaved , but they had one  sad fault : they were too fond of pies and tarts . It was as disagreeable  to them to swallow a spoonful of soup as if it were so much sea  water , and it would take a policeman to make them open their mouths  for a bit of meat , either boiled or roasted . This deplorable taste  made the fortunes of the pastry cooks , but also of the apothecaries .  Families ruined themselves in pills and powders ; camomile , rhubarb , and  peppermint trebled in price , as well as other disagreeable remedies ,  such as castor----which I will not name .  The King of the Greedy sought long for the means of correcting this  fatal passion for sweets , but even the faculty were puzzled .  "" Your Majesty , "" said the great court doctor , Olibriers , at his last  audience , "" your people look like putty ! They are incurable ; their  senseless love for good eating will bring them all to the grave . ""  This view of things did not suit the King . He was wise , and saw very  plainly that a monarch without subjects would be but a sorry king .  Happily , after this utter failure of the doctors , there came into the  mind of His Majesty a first - class idea : he telegraphed for Mother  Mitchel , the most celebrated of all pastry cooks . Mother Mitchel  soon arrived , with her black cat , Fanfreluche , who accompanied her  everywhere . He was an incomparable cat . He had not his equal as an  adviser and a taster of tarts .  Mother Mitchel having respectfully inquired what she and her cat could  do for His Majesty , the King demanded of the astonished pastry cook a  tart as big as the capitol -- bigger even , if possible , but no smaller !  When the King uttered this astounding order , deep emotion was shown by  the chamberlains , the pages , and lackeys . Nothing but the respect due  to his presence prevented them from crying "" Long live Your Majesty ! "" in  his very ears . But the King had seen enough of the enthusiasm of the  populace , and did not allow such sounds in the recesses of his palace .  The King gave Mother Mitchel one month to carry out his gigantic  project . "" It is enough ,"	1	0
 On the way Mother Mitchel arranged in her head the plan of the monument  which was to immortalize her , and considered the means of executing  it . As to its form and size , it was to be as exact a copy of the  capitol as possible , since the King had willed it ; but its outside  crust should have a beauty all its own . The dome must be adorned with  sugarplums of all colours , and surmounted by a splendid crown of  macaroons , spun sugar , chocolate , and candied fruits . It was no small  affair .  Mother Mitchel did not like to lose her time . Her plan of battle once  formed , she recruited on her way all the little pastry cooks of the  country , as well as all the tiny six - year - olds who had a sincere love  for the noble callings of scullion and apprentice . There were plenty of  these , as you may suppose , in the country of the Greedy ; Mother Mitchel  had her pick of them .  Mother Mitchel , with the help of her crutch and of Fanfreluche , who  miaowed loud enough to be heard twenty miles off , called upon all the  millers of the land , and commanded them to bring together at a certain  time as many sacks of fine flour as they could grind in a week . There  were only windmills in that country ; you may easily believe how they  all began to go . B - r - r - r - r - r ! What a noise they made ! The clatter was  so great that all the birds flew away to other climes , and even the  clouds fled from the sky .  At the call of Mother Mitchel all the farmers ' wives were set to work ;  they rushed to the hencoops to collect the seven thousand fresh eggs  that Mother Mitchel wanted for her great edifice . Deep was the emotion  of the fowls . The hens were inconsolable , and the unhappy creatures  mourned upon the palings for the loss of all their hopes .  The milkmaids were busy from morning till night in milking the cows .  Mother Mitchel must have twenty thousand pails of milk . All the little  calves were put on half rations . This great work was nothing to them ,  and they complained pitifully to their mothers . Many of the cows  protested with energy against this unreasonable tax , which made their  young families so uncomfortable . There were pails upset , and even some  milkmaids went head over heels . But these little accidents did not  chill the enthusiasm of the labourers .	1	0
"Their dashers dashed without ceasing , keeping perfect time . The  butter was tasted , rolled into pats , wrapped up , and put into baskets .  Such energy had never been known before .  Mother Mitchel passed for a sorceress . It was all because of her cat ,  Fanfreluche , with whom she had mysterious doings and pantomimes ,  and with whom she talked in her inspired moments , as if he were a  real person . Certainly , since the famous "" Puss in Boots , "" there had  never been an animal so extraordinary ; and credulous folks suspected  him of being a magician . Some curious people had the courage to ask  Fanfreluche if this were true ; but he had replied by bristling , and  showing his teeth and claws so fiercely , that the conversation had  ended there . Sorceress or not , Mother Mitchel was always obeyed . No one  else was ever served so punctually .  On the appointed day all the millers arrived with their asses trotting  in single file , each laden with a great sack of flour . Mother Mitchel ,  after having examined the quality of the flour , had every sack  accurately weighed . This was head work and hard work , and took time ;  but Mother Mitchel was untiring , and her cat , also , for while the  operation lasted he sat on the roof watching . It is only just to say  that the millers of the Greedy Kingdom brought flour not only faultless  but of full weight . They knew that Mother Mitchel was not joking when  she said that others must be as exact with her as she was with them .  Perhaps also they were a little afraid of the cat , whose great green  eyes were always shining upon them like two round lamps , and never lost  sight of them for one moment .  All the farmers ' wives arrived in turn , with baskets of eggs upon their  heads . They did not load their donkeys with them , for fear that in  jogging along they would become omelettes on the way . Mother Mitchel  received them with her usual gravity . She had the patience to look  through every egg to see if it were fresh .  She did not wish to run the risk of having young chickens in a tart  that was destined for those who could not bear the taste of any meat  however tender and delicate . The number of eggs was complete , and  again Mother Mitchel and her cat had nothing to complain of . This  Greedy nation , though carried away by love of good eating , was strictly  honest . It must"	1	0
 And now the milkmaids with their pots and pails of milk , and the  buttermakers with their baskets filled with the rich yellow pats of  butter , filed in long procession to the right and left of the cabin  of Mother Mitchel . There was no need for her to examine so carefully  the butter and the milk . She had such a delicate nose that if there  had been a single pat of ancient butter or a pail of sour milk she  would have pounced upon it instantly . But all was perfectly fresh . In  that golden age they did not understand the art , now so well known , of  making milk out of flour and water . Real milk was necessary to make  cheesecakes and ice cream and other delicious confections much adored  in the Greedy Kingdom . If any one had made such a despicable discovery ,  he would have been chased from the country as a public nuisance .  Then came the grocers , with their aprons of coffee bags , and with the  jolly , mischievous faces the rogues always have . Each one clasped  to his heart a sugar loaf nearly as large as himself , whose summit ,  without its paper cap , looked like new - fallen snow upon a pyramid .  Mother Mitchel , with her crutch for a baton , saw them all placed in her  storerooms upon shelves put up for the purpose . She had to be very  strict , for some of the little fellows could hardly part from their  merchandise , and many were indiscreet , with their tongues behind their  great mountains of sugar . If they had been let alone , they would never  have stopped till the sugar was all gone . But they had not thought  of the implacable eye of old Fanfreluche , who , posted upon a water  spout , took note of all their misdeeds . From another quarter came a  whole army of country people , rolling wheelbarrows and carrying huge  baskets , all filled with cherries , plums , peaches , apples , and pears .  All these fruits were so fresh , in such perfect condition , with their  fair shining skins , that they looked like wax or painted marble , but  their delicious perfume proved that they were real . Some little people ,  hidden in the corners , took pains to find this out . Between ourselves ,  Mother Mitchel made believe not to see them , and took the precaution of  holding Fanfreluche in her arms so that he could not spring upon them .  The fruits were all put into bins , each kind by itself . And now the  preparations were finished . There	1	0
This hill  commanded the capital city , built upon the slope of another hill close  by . After having beaten down the earth till it was as smooth as a  floor , they spread over it loads of bread crumbs , brought from the  baker 's , and levelled it with rake and spade , as we do gravel in our  garden walks . Little birds , as greedy as themselves , came in flocks to  the feast , but they might eat as they liked , it would never be missed ,  so thick was the carpet . It was a great chance for the bold little  things .  All the ingredients for the tart were now ready . Upon order of Mother  Mitchel they began to peel the apples and pears and to take out the  pips . The weather was so pleasant that the girls sat out of doors , upon  the ground , in long rows . The sun looked down upon them with a merry  face . Each of the little workers had a big earthen pan , and peeled  incessantly the apples which the boys brought them . When the pans were  full , they were carried away and others were brought . They had also  to carry away the peels , or the girls would have been buried in them .  Never was there such a peeling before .  Not far away , the children were stoning the plums , cherries , and  peaches . This work , being the easiest , was given to the youngest and  most inexperienced hands , which were all first carefully washed , for  Mother Mitchel , though not very particular about her own toilet , was  very neat in her cooking . The schoolhouse , long unused ( for in the  country of the Greedy they had forgotten everything ) , was arranged  for this second class of workers , and the cat was their inspector . He  walked round and round , growling if he saw the fruit popping into any  of the little mouths . If they had dared , how they would have pelted  him with plum stones ! But no one risked it . Fanfreluche was not to be  trifled with .  In those days powdered sugar had not been invented , and to grate it all  was no small affair . It was the work that the grocers used to dislike  the most ; both lungs and arms were soon tired . But Mother Mitchel  was there to sustain them with her unequalled energy . She chose the  labourers from the most robust of the boys . With mallet and knife she  broke the cones into round pieces , and they grated them till they were 	1	0
But a new miracle was wrought by Mother Mitchel . It was all  there !  It was then the turn of the ambitious scullions to enter the lists and  break the seven thousand eggs for Mother Mitchel . It was not hard to  break them -- any fool could do that ; but to separate adroitly the yolks  and the whites demands some talent , and , above all , great care . We dare  not say that there were no accidents here , no eggs too well scrambled ,  no baskets upset . But the experience of Mother Mitchel had counted  upon such things , and it may truly be said that there were never so  many eggs broken at once , or ever could be again . To make an omelette  of them would have taken a saucepan as large as a skating pond , and  the fattest cook that ever lived could not hold the handle of such a  saucepan .  But this was not all . Now that the yolks and whites were once divided ,  they must each be beaten separately in wooden bowls , to give them  the necessary lightness . The egg beaters were marshalled into two  brigades , the yellow and the white . Every one preferred the white , for  it was much more amusing to make those snowy masses that rose up so  high than to beat the yolks , which knew no better than to mix together  like so much sauce . Mother Mitchel , with her usual wisdom , had avoided  this difficulty by casting lots . Thus , those who were not on the white  side had no reason to complain of oppression . And truly , when all was  done , the whites and the yellows were equally tired . All had cramps in  their hands .  Now began the real labour of Mother Mitchel . Till now she had been the  commander - in - chief -- the head only ; now she put her own finger in the  pie . First , she had to make sweetmeats and jam out of all the immense  quantity of fruit she had stored . For this , as she could only do one  kind at a time , she had ten kettles , each as big as a dinner table .  During forty - eight hours the cooking went on ; a dozen scullions blew  the fire and put on the fuel . Mother Mitchel , with a spoon that four  modern cooks could hardly lift , never ceased stirring and trying the  boiling fruit . Three expert tasters , chosen from the most dainty , had  orders to report progress every half hour .  It is unnecessary to state that all the	1	0
"When  each kind of sweetmeat was finished , she skimmed it , and put it away  to cool in enormous bowls before potting . She did not use for this the  usual little glass or earthen jars , but great stone ones , like those  in the "" Forty Thieves . "" Not only did these take less time to fill ,  but they were safe from the children . The scum and the scrapings were  something , to be sure . But there was little Toto , who thought this was  not enough . He would have jumped into one of the bowls if they had not  held him .  Mother Mitchel , who thought of everything , had ordered two hundred  great kneading troughs , wishing that all the utensils of this great  work should be perfectly new . These two hundred troughs , like her other  materials , were all delivered punctually and in good order . The pastry  cooks rolled up their sleeves and began to knead the dough with cries  of "" Hi ! Hi ! "" that could be heard for miles . It was odd to see this army  of bakers in serried ranks , all making the same gestures at once , like  well - disciplined soldiers , stooping and rising together in time , so  that a foreign ambassador wrote to his court that he wished his people  could load and fire as well as these could knead . Such praise a people  never forgets .  When each troughful of paste was approved it was moulded with care into  the form of bricks , and with the aid of the engineer - in - chief , a young  genius who had gained the first prize in the school of architecture ,  the majestic edifice was begun . Mother Mitchel herself drew the plan ;  in following her directions , the young engineer showed himself modest  beyond all praise . He had the good sense to understand that the  architecture of tarts and pies had rules of its own , and that therefore  the experience of Mother Mitchel was worth all the scientific theories  in the world .  The inside of the monument was divided into as many compartments as  there were kinds of fruits . The walls were no less than four feet  thick . When they were finished , twenty - four ladders were set up ,  and twenty - four experienced cooks ascended them . These first - class  artists were each of them armed with an enormous cooking spoon . Behind  them , on the lower rounds of the ladders , followed the kitchen boys ,  carrying on their heads pots and pans filled to the brim with jam and  sweetmeats ,"	1	0
 When the sweetmeats were used to the last drop , when the great spoons  had done all their work , the twenty - four cooks descended to earth  again . The intrepid Mother Mitchel , who had never quitted the spot , now  ascended , followed by the noble Fanfreluche , and dipped her finger into  each of the compartments , to assure herself that everything was right .  This part of her duty was not disagreeable , and many of the scullions  would have liked to perform it . But they might have lingered too long  over the enchanting task . As for Mother Mitchel , she had been too well  used to sweets to be excited now . She only wished to do her duty and to  insure success .  All went on well . Mother Mitchel had given her approbation . Nothing was  needed now but to crown the sublime and delicious edifice by placing  upon it the crust -- that is , the roof , or dome . This delicate operation  was confided to the engineer - in - chief who now showed his superior  genius . The dome , made beforehand of a single piece , was raised in the  air by means of twelve balloons , whose force of ascension had been  carefully calculated . First it was directed , by ropes , exactly over the  top of the tart ; then at the word of command it gently descended upon  the right spot . It was not a quarter of an inch out of place . This was  a great triumph for Mother Mitchel and her able assistant .  But all was not over . How should this colossal tart be cooked ? That was  the question that agitated all the people of the Greedy country , who  came in crowds -- lords and commons -- to gaze at the wonderful spectacle .  Some of the envious or ill - tempered declared it would be impossible to  cook the edifice which Mother Mitchel had built ; and the doctors were ,  no one knows why , the saddest of all . Mother Mitchel , smiling at the  general bewilderment , mounted the summit of the tart ; she waved her  crutch in the air , and while her cat miaowed in his sweetest voice ,  suddenly there issued from the woods a vast number of masons , drawing  wagons of well - baked bricks , which they had prepared in secret . This  sight silenced the ill - wishers and filled the hearts of the Greedy with  hope .  In two days an enormous furnace was built around and above the colossal  tart , which found itself shut up in an immense earthen pot . Thirty  huge mouths	1	0
Of course the kindlings had  not been forgotten , and was all soon in a blaze .  When the fire was lighted in the thirty ovens , when they saw the clouds  of smoke rolling above the dome , that announced that the cooking had  begun , the joy of the people was boundless . Poets improvised odes ,  and musicians sung verses without end , in honour of the superb prince  who had been inspired to feed his people in so dainty a manner , when  other rulers could not give them enough even of dry bread . The names of  Mother Mitchel and of the illustrious engineer were not forgotten in  this great glorification . Next to His Majesty , they were certainly the  first of mankind , and their names were worthy of going down with his to  the remotest posterity .  All the envious ones were thunderstruck . They tried to console  themselves by saying that the work was not yet finished , and that an  accident might happen at the last moment . But they did not really  believe a word of this . Notwithstanding all their efforts to look  cheerful , it had to be acknowledged that the cooking was possible .  Their last resource was to declare the tart a bad one , but that would  be biting off their own noses . As for declining to eat it , envy could  never go so far as that in the country of the Greedy .  After two days , the unerring nose of Mother Mitchel discovered that the  tart was cooked to perfection . The whole country was perfumed with its  delicious aroma . Nothing more remained but to take down the furnaces .  Mother Mitchel made her official announcement to His Majesty , who was  delighted , and complimented her upon her punctuality . One day was still  wanting to complete the month . During this time the people gave their  eager help to the engineer in the demolition , wishing to have a hand  in the great national work and to hasten the blessed moment . In the  twinkling of an eye the thing was done . The bricks were taken down one  by one , counted carefully , and carried into the forest again , to serve  for another occasion .  The TART , unveiled , appeared at last in all its majesty and splendour .  The dome was gilded , and reflected the rays of the sun in the most  dazzling manner . The wildest excitement and rapture ran through  the land of the Greedy . Each one sniffed with open nostrils the  appetizing perfume . Their mouths watered , their eyes filled with  tears , they embraced , pressed each other 's	1	0
" No one dared to touch the tart before the arrival of His Majesty .  Meanwhile , something must be done to allay the universal impatience ,  and they resolved to show Mother Mitchel the gratitude with which all  hearts were filled . She was crowned with the laurel of _ conquerors _ ,  which is also the laurel of _ sauce _ , thus serving a double purpose .  Then they placed her , with her crutch and her cat , upon a sort of  throne , and carried her all round her vast work . Before her marched all  the musicians of the town , dancing , drumming , fifing , and tooting upon  all instruments , while behind her pressed an enthusiastic crowd , who  rent the air with their plaudits and filled it with a shower of caps .  Her fame was complete , and a noble pride shone on her countenance .  The royal procession arrived . A grand stairway had been built , so that  the King and his ministers could mount to the summit of this monumental  tart . Thence the King , amid a deep silence , thus addressed his people :  "" My children , "" said he , "" you adore tarts . You despise all other food .  If you could , you would even eat tarts in your sleep . Very well . Eat  as much as you like . Here is one big enough to satisfy you . But know  this , that while there remains a single crumb of this august tart , from  the height of which I am proud to look down on you , all other food is  forbidden you on pain of death . While you are here , I have ordered all  the pantries to be emptied and , all the butchers , bakers , pork milk  dealers , and fishmongers to shut up their shops . Why leave them open ?  Why indeed ? Have you not here at discretion what you love best , and  enough to last you ever , _ ever _ so long ? Devote yourselves to it with  all your hearts . I do not wish you to be bored with the sight of any  other food .  "" Greedy ones ! behold your TART ! ""  What enthusiastic applause . What frantic hurrahs rent the air , in  answer to this eloquent speech from the throne !  "" Long live the King , Mother Mitchel , and her cat ! Long live the tart !  Down with soup ! Down with bread ! To the bottom of the sea with all  beefsteaks , mutton chops , and roasts ! ""  Such cries came from every lip . Old men gently stroked their"	1	0
" Grave professors , skipping like kids , declaimed Latin verses in honour  of His Majesty and Mother Mitchel , and the shyest young girls opened  their mouths like the beaks of little birds . As for the doctors , they  felt a joy beyond expression . They had reflected . They understood .  But -- my friends!----  At last the signal was given . A detachment of the engineer corps  arrived , armed with pick and cutlass , and marched in good order to the  assault . A breach was soon opened , and the distribution began . The  King smiled at the opening in the tart ; though vast , it hardly showed  more than a mouse hole in the monstrous wall .  The King stroked his beard grandly . "" All goes well , "" said he , "" for him  who knows how to wait . ""  Who can tell how long the feast would have lasted if the King had not  given his command that it should cease ? Once more they expressed their  gratitude with cries so stifled that they resembled grunts , and then  rushed to the river . Never had a nation been so besmeared . Some were  daubed to the eyes , others had their ears and hair all sticky . As for  the little ones , they were marmalade from head to foot . When they  had finished their toilets , the river ran all red and yellow and was  sweetened for several hours , to the great surprise of all the fishes .  Before returning home , the people presented themselves before the King  to receive his commands .  "" Children ! "" said he , "" the feast will begin again exactly at six  o'clock . Give time to wash the dishes and change the tablecloths , and  you may once more give yourselves over to pleasure . You shall feast  twice a day as long as the tart lasts . Do not forget . Yes ! if there is  not enough in this one , I will even order ANOTHER from Mother Mitchel ;  for you know that great woman is indefatigable . Your happiness is my  only aim . "" ( Marks of universal joy and emotion . ) "" You understand ? Noon ,  and six o'clock ! There is no need for me to say be punctual ! Go , then ,  my children -- be happy ! ""  The second feast was as gay as the first , and as long . A pleasant  walk in the suburbs -- first exercise -- then a nap , had refreshed their  appetites and unlimbered their jaws . But the King fancied that the  breach made in the tart was a little"	1	0
" "" Why is this ? "" said he , with pretended indifference , to the court  physician .  "" Your Majesty , "" said the great Olibriers , "" a few weak stomachs ; that is  all . ""  On the next day there were larger empty spaces . The enthusiasm visibly  abated . The eighth day the crowd had diminished one half ; the ninth ,  three quarters ; the tenth day , of the thousand who came at first , only  two hundred remained ; on the eleventh day only one hundred ; and on the  twelfth -- alas ! who would have thought it?--a single one answered to  the call . Truly he was big enough . His body resembled a hogshead , his  mouth an oven , and his lips -- we dare not say what . He was known in the  town by the name of Patapouf . They dug out a fresh lump for him from  the middle of the tart . It quickly vanished in his vast interior , and  he retired with great dignity , proud to maintain the honour of his name  and the glory of the Greedy Kingdom .  But the next day , even he , the very last , appeared no more . The  unfortunate Patapouf had succumbed , and , like all the other  inhabitants of the country , was in a very bad way . In short , it was  soon known that the whole town had suffered agonies that night from  too much tart . Let us draw a veil over those hours of torture . Mother  Mitchel was in despair . Those ministers who had not guessed the secret  dared not open their lips . All the city was one vast hospital . No one  was seen in the streets but doctors and apothecaries ' boys , running  from house to house in frantic haste . It was dreadful ! Doctor Olibriers  was nearly knocked out . As for the King , he held his tongue and shut  himself up in his palace , but a secret joy shone in his eyes , to the  wonder of every one . He waited three days without a word .  The third day , the King said to his ministers :  "" Let us go now and see how my poor people are doing , and feel their  pulse a little . ""  The good King went to every house , without forgetting a single one . He  visited small and great , rich and poor .  "" Oh , oh ! Your Majesty , "" said all , "" the tart was good , but may we never  see it again ! Plague on that tart ! Better were dry bread"	1	0
" _ There is more of that tart ! _   "" What ! Your Majesty , _ must _ we eat it all ? ""  "" You _ must _ ! "" sternly replied the King ; "" you _ MUST _ ! By the immortal  beefsteaks ! not one of you shall have a slice of bread , and not a loaf  shall be baked in the kingdom while there remains a crumb of that  excellent tart ! ""  "" What misery ! "" thought these poor people . "" That tart forever ! ""  The sufferers were in despair . There was only one cry through all the  town : "" Ow ! ow ! ow ! "" For even the strongest and most courageous were in  horrible agonies . They twisted , they writhed , they lay down , they got  up . Always the inexorable colic . The dogs were not happier than their  masters ; even they had too much tart .  The spiteful tart looked in at all the windows . Built upon a height , it  commanded the town . The mere sight of it made everybody ill , and its  former admirers had nothing but curses for it now . Unhappily , nothing  they could say or do made it any smaller ; still formidable , it was a  frightful joke for those miserable mortals . Most of them buried their  heads in their pillows , drew their nightcaps over their eyes , and lay  in bed all day to shut out the sight of it . But this would not do ; they  knew , they felt it was there . It was a nightmare , a horrible burden , a  torturing anxiety .  In the midst of this terrible consternation the King remained  inexorable during eight days . His heart bled for his people , but the  lesson must sink deep if it were to bear fruit in future . When their  pains were cured , little by little , through fasting alone , and his  subjects pronounced these trembling words , "" We are hungry ! "" the King  sent them trays laden with -- the inevitable tart .  "" Ah ! "" cried they , with anguish , "" the tart again ! Always the tart , and  nothing but the tart ! Better were death ! ""  A few , who were almost famished , shut their eyes , and tried to eat  a bit of the detested food ; but it was all in vain -- they could not  swallow a mouthful .  At length came the happy day when the King , thinking their punishment  had been severe enough and could never be forgotten , believed them at  length cured"	1	0
They received it with as much rapture as the  Hebrews did the manna in the desert . They would gladly have had twice  as much , but after their long fast it would not have been prudent .  It was a proof that they had learned something already , that they  understood this .  The next day , more soup . This time the King allowed slices of bread in  it . How this good soup comforted all the town ! The next day there was a  little more bread in it and a little soup meat . Then for a few days the  kind Prince gave them roast beef and vegetables . The cure was complete .  The joy over this new diet was as great as ever had been felt for the  tart . It promised to last longer . They were sure to sleep soundly ,  and to wake refreshed . It was pleasant to see in every house tables  surrounded with happy , rosy faces , and laden with good nourishing food .  The Greedy people never fell back into their old ways . Their once  puffed - out , sallow faces shone with health ; they became , not fat , but  muscular , ruddy , and solid . The butchers and bakers reopened their  shops ; the pastry cooks and confectioners shut theirs . The country of  the Greedy was turned upside down , and if it kept its name , it was  only from habit . As for the tart , it was forgotten . To - day , in that  marvellous country , there can not be found a paper of sugarplums or a  basket of cakes . It is charming to see the red lips and the beautiful  teeth of the people . If they have still a king , he may well be proud to  be their ruler .  Does this story teach that tarts and pies should never be eaten ? No ;  but there is reason in all things .  The doctors alone did not profit by this great revolution . They could  not afford to drink wine any longer in a land where indigestion had  become unknown . The apothecaries were no less unhappy , spiders spun  webs over their windows , and their horrible remedies were no longer of  use .  Ask no more about Mother Mitchel . She was ridiculed without measure by  those who had adored her . To complete her misfortune , she lost her cat .  Alas for Mother Mitchel !  The King received the reward of his wisdom . His grateful people called  him neither Charles the Bold , nor Peter the Terrible , nor Louis the  Great , but always by the noble name of	1	0
"There is a doll in the story , but boys will      not mind this as there are also two turkey - gobblers and      a pewter dish full of Revolutionary bullets .  SUBMIT THOMPSON sat on the stone wall ; Sarah Adams , an erect , prim  little figure , ankle - deep in dry grass , stood beside it , holding  Thankful . Thankful was about ten inches long , made of the finest linen ,  with little rosy cheeks , and a fine little wig of flax . She wore a  blue wool frock and a red cloak . Sarah held her close . She even drew  a fold of her own blue homespun blanket around her to shield her from  the November wind . The sky was low and gray ; the wind blew from the  northeast , and had the breath of snow in it . Submit on the wall drew  her quilted petticoats close down over her feet , and huddled herself  into a small space , but her face gleamed keen and resolute out of the  depths of a great red hood that belonged to her mother . Her eyes were  fixed upon a turkey - gobbler ruffling and bobbing around the back door  of the Adams house . The two gambrel - roofed Thompson and Adams houses  were built as close together as if the little village of Bridgewater  were a city . Acres of land stretched behind them and at the other  sides , but they stood close to the road , and close to each other .  The narrow space between them was divided by a stone wall which was  Submit 's and Sarah 's trysting - place . They met there every day and  exchanged confidences . They loved each other like sisters -- neither of  them had an own sister -- but to - day a spirit of rivalry had arisen .  The tough dry blackberry vines on the wall twisted around Submit ; she  looked , with her circle of red petticoat , like some strange late flower  blooming out on the wall . "" I know he do n't , Sarah Adams , "" said she .  "" Father said he 'd weigh twenty pounds , "" returned Sarah , in a small ,  weak voice , which still had persistency in it .  "" I do n't believe he will . Our Thanksgiving turkey is twice as big . You  know he is , Sarah Adams . ""  "" No , I do n't , Submit Thompson . ""  "" Yes , you do . ""  Sarah lowered her chin , and shook her head with a decision that was  beyond words . She was a thin , delicate - looking little girl ,"	1	0
" Submit 's black eyes in the depths of it were like two sparks . She  nodded vehemently ; the gesture was not enough for her ; she nodded and  spoke together . "" Sarah Adams , "" said she , "" what will you give me if our  turkey is bigger than your turkey ? ""  "" It ai n't . ""  "" What will you give me if it is ? ""  Sarah stared at Submit . "" I do n't know what you mean , Submit Thompson , ""  said she , with a stately and puzzled air .  "" Well , I 'll tell you . If your turkey weighs more than ours I 'll give  you -- I'll give you my little work - box with the picture on the top , and  if our turkey weighs more than yours you give me---- What will you give  me , Sarah Adams ? ""  Sarah hung her flaxen head with a troubled air . "" I do n't know , "" said  she . "" I do n't believe I 've got anything mother would be willing to have  me give away . ""  "" There 's Thankful . Your mother would n't care if you gave her away . ""  Sarah started , and hugged Thankful closer . "" Yes , my mother would care ,  too , "" said she . "" Do n't you know my Aunt Rose from Boston made her and  gave her to me ? ""  Sarah 's beautiful young Aunt Rose from Boston was the special  admiration of both the little girls . Submit was ordinarily impressed by  her name , but now she took it coolly .  "" What if she did ? "" she returned . "" She can make another . It 's just made  out of a piece of old linen , anyhow . My work - box is real handsome ; but  you can do just as you are a mind to . ""  "" Do you mean I can have the work - box to keep ? "" inquired Sarah .  "" Course I do , if your turkey 's bigger . ""  Sarah hesitated . "" Our turkey is bigger anyhow , "" she murmured . "" Do n't  you think I ought to ask mother , Submit ? "" she inquired suddenly .  "" No ! What for ? I do n't see anything to ask your mother for . She wo n't  care anything about that rag doll . ""  "" Ai n't you going to ask your mother about the work - box ? ""  "" No , "" replied Submit stoutly . "" It 's mine ; my grandmother gave it to me . "" "	1	0
" Well , I  do n't care ,  she added , finally .  "" Will you ? ""  "" Yes . ""  "" When 's yours going to be killed ? ""  "" This afternoon . ""  "" So 's ours . Then we 'll find out . ""  Sarah tucked Thankful closer under her shawl . "" I know our turkey is  biggest , "" said she . She looked very sober , although her voice was  defiant . Just then the great turkey came swinging through the yard . He  held up his head proudly and gobbled . His every feather stood out in  the wind . He seemed enormous -- a perfect giant among turkeys . "" _ Look _ at  him ! "" said Sarah , edging a little closer to the wall ; she was rather  afraid of him .  "" He ai n't half so big as ours , "" returned Submit , stoutly ; but her heart  sank . The Thompson turkey did look very large .  "" Submit ! Submit ! "" called a voice from the Thompson house .  Submit slowly got down from the wall . "" His feathers are a good deal  thicker than ours , "" she said , defiantly , to Sarah .  "" Submit , "" called the voice , "" come right home ! I want you to pare apples  for the pies . Be quick ! ""  "" Yes , marm , "" Submit answered back , in a shrill voice ; "" I 'm coming ! ""  Then she went across the yard and into the kitchen door of the Thompson  house , like a red robin into a nest . Submit had been taught to obey her  mother promptly . Mrs. Thompson was a decided woman .  Sarah looked after Submit , then she gathered Thankful closer , and  also went into the house . Her mother , as well as Mrs. Thompson , was  preparing for Thanksgiving . The great kitchen was all of a pleasant  litter with pie plates and cake pans and mixing bowls , and full of  warm , spicy odours . The oven in the chimney was all heated and ready  for a batch of apple and pumpkin pies . Mrs. Adams was busy sliding them  in , but she stopped to look at Sarah and Thankful . Sarah was her only  child .  "" Why , what makes you look so sober ? "" said she .  "" Nothing , "" replied Sarah . She had taken off her blanket , and sat in one  of the straight - backed kitchen chairs , holding Thankful .  "" You look dreadful sober , "" said her mother . "" Are"	1	0
"Do you feel  chilly ? ""  "" No , marm . Mother , how much do you suppose our turkey weighs ? ""  "" I believe father said he 'd weigh about twenty pounds . You are sure you  do n't feel chilly ? ""  "" No , marm . Mother , do you suppose our turkey weighs more than Submit 's ? ""  "" How do you suppose I can tell ? I ai n't set eyes on their turkey  lately . If you feel well , you 'd better sit up to the table and stone  that bowl of raisins . Put your dolly away , and get your apron . ""  But Sarah stoned raisins with Thankful in her lap , hidden under her  apron . She was so full of anxiety that she could not bear to put her  away . Suppose the Thompson turkey should be larger , and she should lose  Thankful -- Thankful that her beautiful Aunt Rose had made for her ?  Submit , over in the Thompson house , had sat down at once to her apple  paring . She had not gone into the best room to look at the work - box  whose possession she had hazarded . It stood in there on the table ,  made of yellow satiny wood , with a sliding lid ornamented with a  beautiful little picture . Submit had a certain pride in it , but her  fear of losing it was not equal to her hope of possessing Thankful .  Submit had never had a doll , except a few plebeian ones , manufactured  secretly out of corncobs , whom it took more imagination than she  possessed to admire .  Gradually all emulation over the turkeys was lost in the naughty  covetousness of her little friend and neighbour 's doll . Submit felt  shocked and guilty , but she sat there paring the Baldwin apples , and  thinking to herself : "" If our turkey is only bigger , if it only is ,  then -- I shall have Thankful . "" Her mouth was pursed up and her eyes  snapped . She did not talk at all , but pared very fast .  Her mother looked at her . "" If you do n't take care , you 'll cut your  fingers , "" said she . "" You are in too much of a hurry . I suppose you want  to get out and gossip with Sarah again at the wall , but I ca n't let you  waste any more time to - day . There , I told you you would ! ""  Submit had cut her thumb quite severely . She choked a little when her  mother tied it up , and put on"	1	0
"  And Submit did not let the tears fall . She came from a brave race .  Her great - grandfather had fought in the Revolution ; his sword and  regimentals were packed in the fine carved chest in the best  room . Over the kitchen shelf hung an old musket with which her  great - grandmother , guarding her home and children , had shot an Indian .  In a little closet beside the chimney was an old pewter dish full of  homemade Revolutionary bullets , which Submit and her brothers had for  playthings . A little girl who played with Revolutionary bullets ought  not to cry over a cut thumb .  Submit finished paring the apples after her thumb was tied up , although  she was rather awkward about it . Then she pounded spices in the mortar ,  and picked over cranberries . Her mother kept her busy every minute  until dinnertime . When Submit 's father and her two brothers , Thomas and  Jonas , had come in , she began on the subject nearest her heart .   Father , "" said she , "" how much do you think our Thanksgiving turkey will  weigh ? ""  Mr. Thompson was a deliberate man . He looked at her a minute before  replying . "" Seventeen or eighteen pounds , "" replied he .  "" Oh , Father ! do n't you think he will weigh twenty ? "" Mr. Thompson shook  his head .  "" He do n't begin to weigh so much as the Adams ' turkey , "" said Jonas .  "" Their turkey weighs twenty pounds . ""  "" Oh , Thomas ! do you think their turkey weighs more than ours ? "" cried  Submit .  Thomas was her elder brother ; he had a sober , judicial air like his  father . "" Their turkey weighs considerable more than ours , "" said he .  Submit 's face fell .  "" You are not showing a right spirit , "" said her mother , severely . "" Why  should you care if the Adams ' turkey does weigh more ? I am ashamed of  you ! ""  Submit said no more . She ate her dinner soberly . Afterward she wiped  dishes while her mother washed . All the time she was listening . Her  father and brothers had gone out ; presently she started . "" Oh , Mother ,  they 're killing the turkey ! "" said she .  "" Well , do n't stop while the dishes are hot , if they are , "" returned her  mother .  Submit wiped obediently , but as soon as the dishes were set away , she  stole out in the barn"	1	0
" "" Not till to - night , "" said her father .  "" Submit ! "" called her mother .  Submit went in and swept the kitchen floor . It was an hour after  that , when her mother was in the south room , getting it ready for her  grandparents , who were coming home to Thanksgiving -- they had been on a  visit to their youngest son -- that Submit crept slyly into the pantry .  The turkey lay there on the broad shelf before the window . Submit  looked at him . She thought he was small . "" He was ' most all feathers , ""  she whispered , ruefully . She stood looking disconsolately at the  turkey . Suddenly her eyes flashed and a red flush came over her face .  It was as if Satan , coming into that godly new England home three days  before Thanksgiving , had whispered in her ear .  Presently Submit stole softly back into the kitchen , set a chair before  the chimney cupboard , climbed up , and got the pewter dish full of  Revolutionary bullets . Then she stole back to the pantry and emptied  the bullets into the turkey 's crop . Then she got a needle and thread  from her mother 's basket , sewed up the crop carefully , and set the  empty dish back in the cupboard . She had just stepped down out of the  chair when her brother Jonas came in .  "" Submit , "" said he , "" let 's have one game of odd or even with the  bullets . ""  "" I am too busy , "" said Submit . "" I 've got to spin my stint . ""  "" Just one game . Mother wo n't care . ""  "" No ; I ca n't . ""  Submit flew to her spinning wheel in the corner . Jonas , still  remonstrating , strolled into the pantry .  "" I do n't believe mother wants you in there , "" Submit said anxiously .  "" See here , Submit , "" Jonas called out in an eager voice , "" I 'll get  the steelyards , and we 'll weigh the turkey . We can do it as well as  anybody . ""  Submit left her spinning wheel . She was quite pale with trepidation  when Jonas and she adjusted the turkey in the steelyards . What if those  bullets should rattle out ? But they did not .  "" He weighs twenty pounds and a quarter , "" announced Jonas , with a gasp ,  after peering anxiously at the figures . "" He 's the biggest turkey that  was ever raised in these parts . "" "	1	0
" When Mr. Thompson and Thomas came home at twilight there was a deal of  talk over the turkey .  "" The Adams ' turkey does n't weigh but nineteen pounds , "" Jonas announced .  "" Sarah was out there when they weighed him , and she ' most cried . ""  "" I think Sarah and Submit and all of you are very foolish about it , ""  said Mrs. Thompson severely . "" What difference does it make if one  weighs a pound or two more than the other , if there is enough to go  round ? ""  "" Submit looks as if she was sorry ours weighed the most now , "" said  Jonas .  "" My thumb aches , "" said Submit .  "" Go and get the balm of Gilead bottle , and put some more on , "" ordered  her mother .  That night when she went to bed she could not say her prayers . When she  woke in the morning it was with a strange , terrified feeling , as if she  had climbed a wall into some unknown dreadful land . She wondered if  Sarah would bring Thankful over ; she dreaded to see her coming , but she  did not come . Submit herself did not stir out of the house all that day  or the next , and Sarah did not bring Thankful until next morning .  They were all out in the kitchen about an hour before dinner .  Grandfather Thompson sat in his old armchair at one corner of the  fireplace , Grandmother Thompson was knitting , and Jonas and Submit were  cracking butternuts . Submit was a little happier this morning . She  thought Sarah would never bring Thankful , and so she had not done so  much harm by cheating in the weight of the turkey .  There was a tug at the latch of the kitchen door ; it was pushed open  slowly and painfully , and Sarah entered with Thankful in her arms .  She said not a word to anybody , but her little face was full of woe .  She went straight to Submit , and laid Thankful in her lap ; then she  turned and fled with a great sob . The door slammed after her . All the  Thompsons stopped and looked at Submit .  "" Submit , what does this mean ? "" her father asked .  Submit looked at him , trembling .  "" Speak , "" said he .  "" Submit , mind your father , "" said Mrs. Thompson .  "" What did she bring you the doll baby for ? "" asked Grandmother Thompson .  "" Sarah --- was going to give me Thankful if ---"	1	0
"Even at  eighty he was the recognized head of the house . He was a wonderful  old man , tall and soldierly , and full of a grave dignity . He looked at  Submit , and she shrank .  "" Do you know , "" said he , "" that you have been conducting yourself like  unto the brawlers in the taverns and ale - houses ? ""  "" Yes , sir , "" murmured Submit , although she did not know what he meant .  "" No godly maid who heeds her elders will take part in any such foolish  and sinful wager , "" her grandfather continued .  Submit arose , hugging Thankful convulsively . She glanced wildly at her  great - grandmother 's musket over the shelf . The same spirit that had  aimed it at the Indian possessed her , and she spoke out quite clearly :  "" Our turkey did n't weigh the most , "" said she . "" I put the Revolutionary  bullets in his crop . ""  There was silence . Submit 's heart beat so hard that Thankful quivered .  "" Go upstairs to your chamber , Submit , "" said her mother , "" and you need  not come down to dinner . Jonas , take that doll and carry it over to the  Adams ' house . ""  Submit crept miserably out of the room , and Jonas carried Thankful  across the yard to Sarah .  Submit crouched beside her little square window set with tiny panes of  glass , and watched him . She did not cry . She was very miserable , but  confession had awakened a salutary smart in her soul , like the balm of  Gilead on her cut thumb . She was not so unhappy as she had been . She  wondered if her father would whip her , and she made up her mind not to  cry if he did .  After Jonas came back she still crouched at the window . Exactly  opposite in the Adams ' house was another little square window , and that  lighted Sarah 's chamber . All of a sudden Sarah 's face appeared there .  The two little girls stared pitifully at each other . Presently Sarah  raised her window , and put a stick under it ; then Submit did the same .  They put their faces out , and looked at each other a minute before  speaking . Sarah 's face was streaming with tears .  "" What you crying for ? "" called Submit softly .  "" Father sent me up here 'cause it is sinful to -- make bets , and Aunt  Rose has come , and I ca n't have any -- Thanksgiving dinner , """	1	0
" I put the Revolutionary bullets  in the turkey to make it weigh more than yours . Yours weighed the most .  If mother thinks it 's right , I 'll give you the work - box .   "" I don't -- want it , "" sobbed Sarah . "" I 'm dreadful sorry you 've got to  stay up there , and ca n't have any dinner , Submit . ""  Answering tears sprang to Submit 's eyes . "" I 'm dreadful sorry you 've got  to stay up there , and ca n't have any dinner , "" she sobbed back .  There was a touch on her shoulder . She looked around and there stood  the grandmother . She was trying to look severe , but she was beaming  kindly on her . Her fat , fair old face was as gentle as the mercy that  tempers justice ; her horn spectacles and her knitting needles and the  gold beads on her neck all shone in the sunlight .  "" You had better come downstairs , child , "" said she . "" Dinner 's ' most  ready , and mebbe you can help your mother . Your father is n't going  to whip you this time , because you told the truth about it , but you  must n't ever do such a dreadful wicked thing again . ""  "" No , I wo n't , "" sobbed Submit . She looked across , and there beside  Sarah 's face in the window was another beautiful smiling one . It had  pink cheeks and sweet black eyes and black curls , among which stood a  high tortoise - shell comb .  "" Oh , Submit ! "" Sarah called out , joyfully , "" Aunt Rose says I can go down  to dinner ! ""  "" Grandmother says I can ! "" called back Submit .  The beautiful smiling face opposite leaned close to Sarah 's for a  minute .  "" Oh , Submit ! "" cried Sarah , "" Aunt Rose says she will make you a doll  baby like Thankful , if your mother 's willing ! ""  "" I guess she 'll be willing if she 's a good girl , "" called Grandmother  Thompson .  Submit looked across a second in speechless radiance . Then the faces  vanished from the two little windows , and Submit and Sarah went down to  their Thanksgiving dinners .  BEETLE RING 'S THANKSGIVING MASCOT      Beetle Ring had the reputation of being the toughest      lumber camp on the river . The boys were certainly      rough , and rather hard drinkers , but their hearts were      in the right place , after all .  SIX months of idleness following"	1	0
"It had answered its purpose as a makeshift in  the warm weather , but now , in late November , and with the terrible  northern winter coming swiftly on , it was small wonder the young  lumberman had been discouraged as he tried to forecast the future .  His strength had returned , however , and lately something of his old  courage , for he had found work . It was fifteen miles away , to be sure ,  and in "" Beetle Ring "" lumber camp , the camp that bore the reputation  of being the roughest on the Featherstone , but it was work . He was  earning something , and might hope soon to move his family into a  habitable house and civilization .  But his position at Beetle Ring was not an enviable one . The men  took scant pains to conceal their dislike for the young fellow who  steadfastly refused to "" chip in "" when the camp jug was sent to the  Skylark , the nearest saloon , some miles down the river , and who  invariably declined to join in the camp 's numerous sprees . But Bennett  worked on quietly .  And in the meantime to the old shack in the woods the baby had come -- in  the bleak November weather .  Night was settling down over the woods . An old half - breed woman was  tending the fire in the one room of the shack , and on the wretched bed  lay a fair - faced woman , the young wife and mother , who looked wistfully  out at the bleak woods , white with the first snow , then turned her wan ,  pale face toward the tiny bundle at her side .  "" Your pappy will come to - night , baby , "" she said , softly . "" It 's  Saturday , and your pappy will come to - night , sure . "" She drew the covers  more closely , and tucked them carefully about the small figure .  "" Mend the fire , Lisette , please . It 's cold . And , Lisette , please watch  out down the road . Sometimes Joe comes early Saturdays . ""  The old woman shook her head and muttered over the little pile of wood ,  but she fed the fire , and then turned and looked down the long white  trail .  "" No Joe yet , "" she said , with a sympathetic glance toward the bed . She  looked at the thick gray clouds , and added , "" Heap snow soon . ""  But the night came down and the evening passed , while the women  waited anxiously . It was near midnight when the wife 's"	1	0
"The resolute swing and  bearing of the lumberman -- that had returned as he regained his  strength -- were gone . He clumped across the room unsteadily on a pair  of rude crutches , his left foot swathed in bandages -- a big , ungainly  bundle .  "" What is it , Joe ? "" the wife asked anxiously .  "" Just more of my precious luck , that 's all , Nannie . "" He threw off the  old box coat and heavy cap , brushed the melting snow from his hair  and beard , and without waiting to warm his chilled hands at the fire ,  hobbled to the bed and bent over the woman and the tiny bundle .  "" Are you all right , Nan ? "" he asked anxiously .  "" All right , Joe ; but I 've been so worried ! ""  "" And the baby , Nan ? ""  The wife gently pushed back the covers and proudly brought to view a  tiny pink and puckered face . "" Fine , Joe . She 's just as fine , is n't she ? ""  A proud , happy light flickered for a moment in the man 's eyes as  he stooped to kiss the tiny face ; then he shut his teeth hard and  swallowed suddenly .  "" What is it , Joe ? "" his wife asked , looking at the rudely bandaged foot .  "" Cut it -- nigh half off , and hurt the bone . It 'll be weeks before I can  do a stroke of work again . It means -- I do n't know what , and I dare n't  think what , Nannie . The cook sewed it up . "" He glowered at the injured  member savagely .  His wife 's face grew paler still , but she only asked tenderly , "" How did  you ever get here , Joe ? ""  "" Rode one of Pose Breem 's hosses -- his red roan . ""  "" Fifteen miles on horseback with that foot ? I should have thought it  would have killed you , Joe . ""  "" I had to come , Nan , "" said the lumberman . "" I did n't know how you were  getting on , and I had to come . ""  "" I did n't suppose they 'd let you have a horse , any of 'em , now  sleighing 's come . ""  "" They wouldn't -- if I 'd asked 'em . They do n't seem to like me very well ,  and I did n't ask . ""  His wife 's big , wistful eyes were turned upon him in quick alarm . "" I 'm  scared"	1	0
"I 've sent the horse back by Pikepole Pete . He 'll  have him back before morning -- Pose wo n't miss him till then -- and I  wrote a note explaining . Pose will be mad some , but he 'll get over it . ""  The young lumberman listened uneasily to the storm , which was  increasing , looked at his wife 's pale face a moment , and added :  "" I had to come , Nan . I just had to . ""  But the woman was only half reassured . "" If anything should happen , "" she  said , "" if he should n't get it back , they 'd think you -- you stole it ,  and---- ""  "" There , there , Nan ! "" broke in her husband , "" do n't be crossing bridges .  Pete'll take the horse back . I 've done the fellow lots of favours , and  he wo n't go back on me . Do n't worry , girl ! ""  He moved the bandaged foot and winced , but not from the pain of the  wound . The hard look grew deeper on his face . "" I 'm down on my luck ,  Nan , "" he said , hopelessly . "" There 's no use trying . Everything 's against  me , everything -- following me like grim death . And grim death , "" he  jerked the words out harshly , "" is like to be the end of it , here in  this old shack that 's not fit to winter hogs in , let alone humans .  There 's not wood enough cut to last a week . You 'll freeze , Nan , you and  the baby , and I'm -- just nothing . ""  He took two silver dollars from his pocket , and said , almost savagely ,  "" There 's what we 've got to winter on , and me crippled . ""  But his wife put her hand on his softly . "" Do n't you give up so , Joe , ""  she said . And presently she added : "" Next Thursday 's Thanksgiving . We 've  seen hard times , and we may see harder , but I never knew Thanksgiving  to come yet without something to be thankful for -- never . ""  Outside the storm continued , fine snow sifting down rapidly . "" Pikepole  Pete "" found stiff work facing it , and bent low over the red roan 's neck .  "" Blue blazes ! "" he muttered . "" Bennett 's a good fellow all right , and  he 's hurt ; but if he had n't nigh saved my life twice he could get this "	1	0
"I 'll hitch in his barn a spell and go on later , "" and he  took the Turner fork .  But at Turner 's Pete found two or three congenial spirits -- and a jug ;  and a few hours later the easy - going fellow was deep in a tipsy sleep  that would last for hours .  The following Sunday morning came bright and clear upon freshly fallen  snow that softened all the ruder outlines of town and field and woods .  Beetle Ring camp lay wrapped in fleecy whiteness .  The camp was late astir , for Sunday was Beetle Ring 's day -- not of rest ,  but of carousal . Two men had started out rather early -- the camp 's jug  delegation to the Skylark . Presently the men began to straggle out to  the snug row of sheds where the horses were kept . Posey Breem yawned  lazily as he threw open the door of his particular stall , then suddenly  brought himself together with a jerk and stared fixedly .  "" What ails you now , Pose ? Seen a ghost ? ""  "" Skid "" Thomson stopped with the big measure of feed which he was  carrying .  "" No , I 've seen no ghost , "" said Breem slowly , still staring . "" Look  here , Skid ! "" Thomson looked into the stall , and nearly dropped the  measure .  "" By George , Pose ! "" he said . "" By -- George ! ""  The news flew over the camp like wildfire . Posey Breem 's red roan ,  the best horse in the camp , had been stolen ! The burly lumbermen came  hurrying from all directions . There was no doubt about it -- the horse  was gone , and the snow had covered every trace . There was absolutely no  clue to follow . Silently and sullenly the men filed in to breakfast . In  a lumberman 's eyes hardly a crime could exceed that of horse stealing .  "" What I want to know is , "" said Breem , as he glanced sharply round  the long room of the camp , "" what 's become of that yellow - haired  jay -- Bennett ? ""  "" By George ! "" said Skid Thomson , "" that 's right ! Where is the critter ? ""  "" Skipped ! "" said Bill Bates , sententiously , after a quick search had  been made . "" It 's all plain enough now . I never liked the close - fisted  critter . ""  "" Nor I , either ! "" growled Skid . "" Never chipped in with the boys , but was  laying low just the"	1	0
" They 're sharp -- that kind .  The critter knew ' twould snow and hide his tracks .   "" And I 'd just sewed up his blamed foot ! "" muttered the cook in disgust .  "" Maybe we 'll catch him . Up to Fat Pine two years ago , "" began Breem ,  reminiscently , "" Big Donovan had a horse stole . They caught the fellow . ""  "" Yes , I remember , "" said Skid Thomson . "" I was there . We caught him up  north . "" The men nodded understandingly and approvingly .  "" Wuth a hundred and fifty dollars , the roan was , "" said Breem .  Beetle Ring camp passed an uneasy day , the "" jug "" for once receiving  scant attention . Late in the afternoon "" Trapper John , "" an old  half - breed who hunted and trapped about the woods , stopped at the camp  to get warm .  "" Did n't see anybody with a horse last night or this morning , eh , John ? ""  asked Posey Breem .  "" Um , yes , "" responded the old trapper , quickly . "" Saw um horse las '  night -- man ride -- big foot -- so . "" Old John held out his arms in  exaggerated illustration .  Beetle Ring rose to its feet as one man . "" What colour was the horse ,  John ? "" asked Breem softly .  "" Huh ! Ca n't see good after dark , but think um roan . "" Breem looked  slowly round the silent camp , and Beetle Ring grimly made ready for  business .  It was evening when the men stopped a few rods below the shack . A light  shone out from a window , lighting up a little space in the sombre woods .  "" The fellow 's got pals prob'bly , "" said Posey Breem . "" You wait here  while I do a little scouting . ""  Breem crept cautiously into the circle of light , and glancing through  the uncurtained window , saw his man -- with his "" pals . "" He saw upon the  miserable bed a woman with a thin , pale face and sad , wistful eyes ,  eyes that yet lighted up with a beautiful pride as they rested upon the  man , who sat close by , holding a tiny bundle in his arms .  The man shifted his position a little , so that the light fell upon the  bundle , and then the watcher outside saw the sleeping face of a baby .  There was a rumour in the camp that Posey Breem had not always been the  man that"	1	0
" With hungry eyes Breem gazed at the scene in the poor little house ,  his thoughts flying backward over the years . A sudden sharp , impatient  whistle roused him , and he strode hastily back to the waiting men .  "" Well , Pose ? "" interrogated Skid impatiently .  "" He 's there , all right , "" said Breem , in a peculiar tone . "" I ai n't  overmuch given to advising prowling round folks ' houses , but you  fellows just look in yonder . "" He jerked his head toward the shack . And  a line of big , rough - looking men filed into the little illumined space ,  to come back presently silent and subdued .  "" Now let 's go home , "" said Breem , turning his horse toward camp .  "" And your horse , Pose ? "" questioned Bates .  "" Burn the horse ! "" said Breem quickly . "" D'ye think the like of yonder 's  a horse thief ? I ai n't worrying 'bout the horse . "" And the men rode  back to camp silently .  The next morning , when Breem swung open the door of the stall , he was  not surprised to find the red roan standing quietly by the side of his  mate . A bit of crumpled paper was pinned to the blanket . Breem read :      I rode your horse . I had to . I 'll surely make it right .                                                         BENNETT .  "" Course he had to ! "" growled the lumberman , and he passed the paper  round .  "" Oncommon peart baby , "" said Skid , at last .  "" Dreadful cold shack , though ! "" muttered Bates , conveying a quarter of a  griddlecake to his mouth .  "" That 's just it , "" said Pose , scowling . "" Just let a stiff nip of winter  come , and the woman yonder and the little critter , they 'd freeze ,  that 's what they 'd do , in that old rattletrap . ""  The men looked at one another in solemn assent . "" And I 've been  thinking , "" continued Breem , "" since Bennett there belonged to the camp ,  and since we kind of misused the fellow for being stingy -- for which we  ought to have been smashed with logs -- that we have a kind of a claim on  'em , as ' twere , and they on us . And we must get 'em out of that yonder  before they freeze plumb solid . "" He stopped inquiringly .  "" Right as right , "" assented several .  "" And I 've been thinking , """	1	0
" "" And _ I 've _ been thinking , just a little , "" put in Skid Thomson , "" and  if I 've figured correct , next Thursday 's Thanksgiving -- don't know as  I 've thought of it in ten years -- and if we stir round sharp we can  get things ready by then , and -- well , ' twouldn't hurt Beetle Ring to  celebrate for once---- "" But Skid was also interrupted by a cheer .  "" And it 's my firm belief , "" reflected Bates with an air of profound  conviction , "" that that baby of Bennett 's was designed special and , as  you might say , providential , for to be Beetle Ring 's mascot . Fat Pine  and Horseshoe have ' em -- mascots -- to bring luck , and I 've noticed Beetle  Ring ai n't had the luck lately it should have . ""  Bates paused , and the camp meditated in silent delight .  Thanksgiving morning was a cold one , but clear . More snow had fallen ,  and the deep , feathery whiteness stretched away until lost in the dark  background of the pines and spruces . A wavering line of smoke rose over  the roof of the little old shack in the woods .  Bennett was winding rags round the armpieces of the rough crutches .  He had dragged in some short limbs the day before for fuel , but in so  doing had broken open the wound , which gave him excruciating pain .  "" Joe , "" said his wife , suddenly , "" where are you going ? ""  "" I 'm going to try for help , Nan . We 're out of nigh everything , and my  foot no better . ""  "" You ca n't do it , Joe . You -- you'll die , if you try , Joe , alone in the  woods . Oh , Joe ! ""  The look of hope that had never wholly left the woman 's eyes was slowly  fading out .  "" We 'll all die if I do n't try , Nannie . I'm---- ""  "" Huh ! "" suddenly exclaimed the old woman , peering out of the little  window . "" Heap men , heap horses ! Look , see 'em come ! ""  Bennett turned hastily , and saw a long line of stalwart men and sturdy  horses threshing resolutely through the deep snow and heading directly  for the shack . He looked keenly at the men , and his face paled a  little , but he said steadily , "" It 's the Beetle Ring men , Nan . ""  His wife gave a sharp cry . "" It 's the"	1	0
"Directly  there came a sounding knock . Bennett opened the door to admit the burly  frame of Posey Breem . He said quietly :  "" I 'm here all right , Pose , and I took your horse , but---- ""  "" Burn the hoss ! "" said Breem explosively . "" That 's all right . Shake ,  pard ! "" He held out a brawny hand . Bennett "" shook "" wonderingly .  "" Wife , pard ? "" asked Breem , gently , nodding toward the bed . Bennett  hastily introduced him .  "" Kid , pard ? "" Breem pointed a stubby finger at the little bundle .  Bennett nodded .  The lumberman grinned delightedly , then coughed a little , and began  awkwardly :  "" Pard , th ' boys over at Beetle Ring heard -- as you might say ,  accidental""--Breem coughed into his big hand--""about your folks over  here , your wife _ and_--the baby . They were powerful interested ,  specially about the baby . Why , pard , some of the boys hain't seen a  baby in ten years , and we thought as you belonged to the camp , maybe  you and your wife would allow that the camp had a sort of claim on the  little critter yonder . "" He eyed the tiny bundle wistfully .  "" And another thing that hit the boys , pard , "" he went on . "" Up at Fat  Pine they got what they call a mascot , bein ' a tame b'ar ; an ' up  at Horseshoe they got a mascot , bein ' a goat . Lots of camps have  ' em -- fetches luck . And the boys are sure that this baby of yours was  designed special to be Beetle Ring 's mascot . Now , pard , Beetle Ring , as  you know , ai n't what you 'd call a Sunday - school , but the boys they 'll  behave . They fixed up that storeroom to beat all , nice bed , big stove ,  and lots of wood , and so on , and we 've got a cow for the woman and  baby . Say , we want you powerful . Got a sleigh fixed , hemlock boughs  and a cover of robes and blankets , and Skid'll drive careful . He 's  a master at drivin ' , Skid is . You 'll come , wo n't you ? The boys are  waitin ' . ""  Big tears were in the woman 's eyes as she turned toward her husband .  "" Oh , Joe , "" she said , and choked suddenly ; but she pressed the baby  tightly to her breast . "" I knew"	1	0
"  The young mother was soon placed carefully in the sleigh , the old woman  following . But when Skid Thomson appeared in the door of the old shack ,  bearing a tiny form muffled up with wondrous care , the whole of Beetle  Ring shouted .  Breem led up a spare horse for Bennett 's use . The latter stopped short ,  with a curious expression on his face . The horse was the red roan .  But Breem only said , his keen eyes twinkling :   Under such circumstances as these , pard , you 're welcome to all the  hosses in Beetle Ring . ""  With steady , practiced hand Skid Thomson guided his powerful team  through the deep snow , over the rough forest road ; and sometimes brawny  arms carried the sleigh bodily over the roughest places .         *        *        *        *        *  At the close of the day an anxious consultation took place in the big  main room of Beetle Ring , and presently two men appeared outside .  They walked slowly toward what had been the camp 's storeroom , but  halted before the door hesitatingly .  "" You go in ahead , Skid , and ask ' em , "" said Breem , earnestly , to his  companion .  "" No , go ahead yourself , Pose . I 'd be sure to calk a hoss or split a  runner , or somethin' . Go on ! ""  Breem knocked , and both went in .  "" All right , pard ? ""  "" Right as right , Pose , "" said Joe Bennett .  "" Wife all right ? "" Breem turned toward the bed , and Mrs. Bennett smiled  up at him with happy eyes , and with a bit of colour already showing in  her pale face . Breem smiled back broadly . Then he asked , "" _ And _ , pard ,  the baby ? ""  "" Peart as peart , Pose . ""  Breem waited a little , twirling his cap , but receiving a sharp thump  from Thomson , went on :  "" The boys , pard , are anxious about the little critter . They 're kind  of hankering , pard , and , mum , if you are willin ' , and ai n't ' fraid to  trust her with us , why , we 'd be mighty glad to tote her -- just for a  few minutes -- over to camp . The boys are stiddy , all of 'em , stiddy as  churches . They hain't soaked a mite to - day , mum , and they ai n't goin'  to ; they 've hove the jug into a"	1	0
" Breem held up a warning finger when he returned a little later , and  again smiled delightedly .  "" Went to sleep a - totin'--if you 'll believe it , the burned little  critter ! "" he said , softly . "" And , "" he added , "" the boys , pard , are mighty  pleased ; and , mum , they thank you kindly . They say , the boys do , there  ai n't such a mascot as theirs in five hundred miles ; they see luck  comin ' , chunks of it , pard , already . "" And the big fellow went out and  closed the door gently .  MISTRESS ESTEEM ELLIOTT 'S MOLASSES CAKE  THE STORY OF A POSTPONED THANKSGIVING      Older boys and girls who are familiar with "" The      Courtship of Miles Standish "" will enjoy the colonial      flavour of this tale of 1705 .  "" OBED ! "" called Mistress Achsah Ely from her front porch , "" step thee  over to Squire Belding 's , quick ! Here 's a teacup ! Ask Mistress Belding  for the loan of some molasses . Nothing but molasses and hot water helps  the baby when he is having such a turn of colic . Beseems me he will  have a fit ! Make haste , Obed ! ""  At that very moment Squire Belding 's little daughter Hitty was  travelling toward Mistress Ely 's for the purpose of borrowing molasses  wherewith to sweeten a ginger cake . Hitty and Obed , who were of an  age , met , compared notes , and then returned to their respective homes .  Shortly afterward both of them darted forth again , bound on the same  errands as before , only in different directions .  Mr. Chapin , the storekeeper , had n't "" set eyes on any molasses for a  week . The river 's frozen over so mean and solid , "" he said , "" there 's no  knowing when there 'll be any molasses in town . ""  There had been very peculiar weather in Colchester during this month  of October , 1705 . First , on the 13th ( Old Style ) , an unprecedently  early date , had come a "" terrible cold snap , "" lasting three days . This  was followed by two days of phenomenal mildness . The river had frozen  over during the "" cold snap , "" and the ice had melted during the warm  days , until , on the 19th , it was breaking up and preparing to go out  to sea . In the night of the 19th had descended a frigid blast , colder  than the original one . This had arrested the broken ice , piled"	1	0
"It was  most unusual to have the river closed so early in the season , and  consequently the winter supplies , which were secured from New London  and Norwich , had not been laid in . Even Mr. Chapin , the storekeeper ,  was but poorly supplied with staples of which he ordinarily kept an  abundance on hand .  Therefore when Obed and Hitty had made the tour of the neighbourhood  they found but one family , that of Deacon Esteem Elliott , the richest  man in the place , which had any molasses . Mistress Elliott , in spite  of her wealth , was said to be "" none too free with her stuff , "" and  she was not minded to lend any molasses under the circumstances , for  "" a trifling foolish "" cake . Obed 's representation of the distress of  the Ely baby , however , appealed even to her , and she lent him a large  spoonful of the precious liquid .  That afternoon there was as much visiting about among the Colchester  housewives as the drifts permitted . Such a state of things had never  been known since the town was settled . No molasses ! And Thanksgiving  appointed for the first Thursday in November ! Pray what would  Thanksgiving amount to , they inquired , with no pumpkin pies , no baked  beans , no molasses cake , no proper sweetening for the rum so freely  used in those days ?  Mistress Esteem Elliott was even more troubled than the rest of  Colchester , for was not her buxom daughter , and only child , Prudence  Ann , to be married on Thanksgiving Day to the son of a great magnate in  the neighbouring town of Hebron ? And was it not the intention to invite  all of the aristocracy of both towns to be present at the marriage  feast ?  Mistress Elliott accordingly pursued her way upon this Tuesday  afternoon , October 19 , 1705 , over to Mistress Achsah Ely 's . There she  found Mistress Belding , who , remembering Mistress Elliott 's refusal to  lend her molasses , was naturally somewhat chill in her manner .  Mistress Elliott had scarcely pulled off her homespun leggings ( made  with stout and ample feet ) and pulled out her knitting work , when  Mistress Camberly , the parson 's wife , a lady of robust habit and  voluble tongue , came in .  "" And what are we going to do , Mistress Ely ? "" she burst out , as soon as  the door was opened at her knock . "" Not a drop of molasses to be had for  love nor money , and Thanksgiving Day set for the 4th of"	1	0
"  Mistress Ely well understood this little passage - at - arms , for Obed had  told her the whole story ; but as her baby had been cured by Mistress  Elliott 's molasses , she did not think it proper to interfere in the  matter . Neither did the good parson 's wife , although she could not  comprehend the rights of the case . She simply repeated her first  question :  What are we going to do about it , I should like to know ? ""  "" I wonder if Thanksgiving Day could not be put off a week , "" suggested  Mistress Belding , who had a good head , and was even reported to give  such advice to her husband that he always thought best to heed it .  "" Such a thing was never heard of ! "" cried Mistress Elliott .  "" But there 's no law against it , "" insisted Mistress Belding boldly . "" By  a week from the set day there will surely be some means of getting  about the country , and then we can have a Thanksgiving that 's worth the  setting down to . ""  After a long talk the good women separated in some doubt , but as Squire  Belding and Mr. Ely were two of the three selectmen , they were soon  acquainted with the drift of the afternoon 's discussion . The result of  it all is thus chronicled in the town records of Colchester :      "" At a legal town - meeting held in Colchester , October      29 , 1705 , it was voted that _ WHEREAS _ there was a      Thanksgiving appointed to be held on the first Thursday      in November , and our present circumstances being      such that it can not with convenience be attended on      that day , it is therefore voted and agreed by the      inhabitants as aforesaid ( concluding the thing will      not be otherwise than well resented ) that the second      Thursday of November aforesaid shall be set aside for      that service . ""  This proceeding was , on the whole , as the selectmen had hoped that it  would be , "" well resented "" among the Colchester people , but there was  one household in which there was rebellion at the mandate . In the great  sanded kitchen of Deacon Esteem Elliott pretty , spoilt Prudence Ann was  fairly raging over it .  "" I had set my heart on being married on Thanksgiving Day , "" she sobbed .  "" And here it wo n't be Thanksgiving Day at all ! And as for putting off  a wedding , everybody knows there is no surer way of bringing ill luck  down than that ! I"	1	0
"They had known all along that  the Elliotts did not want the festival day put off , but nobody in  Colchester minded very much if the Elliotts were a little crossed .  Prudence Ann would not face the reality till after the Sabbath was  past . On that day the expectant bridegroom managed to break his way  through the drifts from Hebron , and he was truly grieved , as he should  have been , at the very unhappy state of mind of his betrothed . He  avowed himself , however , in a way which augured well for the young  people 's future , ready to do just what Prudence Ann and her family  decided was best .  On Monday morning Mistress Elliott sat down with her unreasonable  daughter and had a serious talk with her .  "" Now , Prudence Ann , "" she began , "" you must give up crying and fretting .  If you are going to be married on Thursday , we have got a great deal of  work to do between now and then . If you are going to wait till next  week , I want to know it . Of course you ca n't have a large party , if  you choose to be married on the 4th , but we will ask John 's folks and  Aunt Susanna and Uncle Martin and Parson Camberley and his wife . We  can bake enough for them with what 's in the house . If you wait another  week , you can probably have a better party -- and now you have it all in  a nutshell . ""  Prudence Ann was hysterical even yet , but at last her terror of a  postponed wedding overcame every other consideration . The day was set  for the 4th , and the few guests were bidden accordingly .  On the morning of the wedding , on a neat shelf in the back kitchen of  the Elliott residence , various delicacies were resting , which had been  baked for the banquet . Mistress Elliott 's molasses had sufficed to make  a vast cake and several pumpkin pies . These , hot from the oven , had  been placed in the coolness of the back kitchen until they should be  ready for eating .  It so happened that Miss Hitty Belding 's sharp eyes , as she passed  Mistress Elliott 's back door , bound on an errand to the house of the  neighbour living just beyond , fell upon the rich golden brown of this  wonderful cake . As such toothsome dainties were rare in Colchester at  just this time , it is not strange that her childish soul coveted it ,  for Hitty was but ten years old . As"	1	0
"It is in her back kitchen . I saw it right by the door . Mean  old thing ! She would n't lend my mother any molasses to make _ us _ a  cake . I wish I had hers ! ""  "" So do I ! "" rejoined Obed , with watering lips . "" I 'm going to peek in and  see it . ""  Obed went and "" peeked , "" while Hitty sauntered slowly on . The  contemplation of the cake under the circumstances was too much for  even so well - brought - up a boy as Obed . Without stopping to really  think what he was doing , he unwound from his neck his great woollen  "" comforter , "" wrapped it hastily around the cake , and was walking with  it beside Hitty in the lonely , drifted country road five minutes  later . The hearts of the two little conspirators -- for they felt guilty  enough -- beat very hard , but they could not help thinking how good that  cake would taste . A certain Goodsir Canty 's cornhouse stood near them  in a clump of trees beside the road , and as the door was open they  crept in , gulped down great "" chunks "" of cake , distributed vast slices  of what was left about their persons , Obed taking by far the lion 's  share , and then they parted , vowing eternal secrecy . Nobody had seen  them , and something which happened just after they had left Mistress  Eliott 's back kitchen directed suspicion to an entirely different  quarter .  Not two minutes after Obed 's "" comforter "" had been thrown around the  great cake a beautiful calf , the pride of Mistress Elliott 's heart , and  which was usually kept tied in the barn just beyond the back kitchen ,  somehow unfastened her rope and came strolling along past the open back  door . The odour of the pumpkin pies naturally interested her , and she  proceeded to lick up the delicious creamy filling of one after another  with great zest .  Just as she was finishing the very last one of the four or five which  had stood there , Mistress Elliott appeared upon the scene , to find  her precious dainties faded like the baseless fabric of a vision ,  leaving behind them only a few broken bits of pie crust . A series of  "" short , sharp shocks "" ( as described in "" The Mikado "" ) then rent the  air , summoning Prudence Ann and Delcy , the maid , to the scene of the  calamity . Let us draw a veil over the succeeding ten minutes .  At the end"	1	0
"It was lucky for Obed and Hitty that  the poor beast could not speak . As it was , nobody so much as thought of  accusing them of the theft , though there were plenty of crumbs in their  pockets , while the death of the innocent heifer was loudly demanded  by the angry Prudence Ann . It was only by artifice and diplomacy that  Mistress Elliott was able to preserve the life of her favourite ,  which , if it had really eaten the cake , must surely have perished .  The wedding finally came off on the 4th , though there was a pouting  bride , and nuts , apples , and cider were said to be the chief  refreshments . Prudence Ann , however , probably secured the "" good luck ""  for which she was so anxious , for there is no record nor tradition to  the contrary in all Colchester .  Nothing would probably ever have been known of the real fate of the  famous cake if the tale had not been told by Mistress Hitty in her old  age to her grandchildren , with appropriate warnings to them never to  commit similar misdemeanours themselves .  Little Obed Ely , the active agent in the theft , died not long after  it . His tombstone , very black and crumbled , stands in one of the old  burying grounds of the town , but nothing is carved upon it as to the  cause of his early death .  The story of the Colchester molasses famine , and the consequent  postponement of their Thanksgiving , naturally spread throughout all  the surrounding towns . It was said that in one of these a party of  roguish boys loaded an old cannon with molasses and fired it in the  direction of Colchester . How they did this has not been stated , and  some irreverent disbelievers in the more uncommon of our grandfathers '  stories have profanely declared it a myth .  THE FIRST THANKSGIVING      A story of the time long ago when the Pilgrims of      Plymouth invited the Indian chief Massasoit and his      followers to share their feast .  ALL through the first summer and the early part of autumn the Pilgrims  were busy and happy . They had planted and cared for their first fields  of corn . They had found wild strawberries in the meadows , raspberries  on the hillsides , and wild grapes in the woods .  In the forest just back of the village wild turkeys and deer were  easily shot . In the shallow waters of the bay there was plenty of fish ,  clams , and lobsters .  The summer had been warm , with a good deal of rain and much sunshine"	1	0
" "" Yes , "" said Elder Brewster , "" let us take a day upon which we may thank  God for all our blessings , and invite to it our Indian friends who have  been so kind to us . ""  The Pilgrims said that one day was not enough ; so they planned to have  a celebration for a whole week . This took place most likely in October .  The great Indian chief , Massasoit , came with ninety of his bravest  warriors , all gayly dressed in deerskins , feathers , and foxtails , with  their faces smeared with red , white , and yellow paint .  As a sign of rank , Massasoit wore round his neck a string of bones and  a bag of tobacco . In his belt he carried a long knife . His face was  painted red , and his hair was so daubed with oil that Governor Bradford  said he "" looked greasily . ""  Now there were only eleven buildings in the whole of Plymouth village ,  four log storehouses and seven little log dwelling - houses ; so the  Indian guests ate and slept out of doors . This was no matter , for it  was one of those warm weeks in the season we call Indian summer .  To supply meat for the occasion four men had already been sent out to  hunt wild turkeys . They killed enough in one day to last the whole  company almost a week .  Massasoit helped the feast along by sending some of his best hunters  into the woods . They killed five deer , which they gave to their  paleface friends , that all might have enough to eat .  Under the trees were built long , rude tables on which were piled baked  clams , broiled fish , roast turkey , and deer meat .  The young Pilgrim women helped serve the food to the hungry redskins .  Let us remember two of the fair girls who waited on the tables . One  was Mary Chilton , who leaped from the boat at Plymouth Rock ; the other  was Mary Allerton . She lived for seventy - eight years after this first  Thanksgiving , and of those who came over in the _ Mayflower _ she was the  last to die .  What a merry time everybody had during that week ! It may be they joked  Governor Bradford about stepping into a deer trap set by the Indians  and being jerked up by the leg .  How the women must have laughed as they told about the first Monday  morning at Cape Cod , when they all went ashore to wash their clothes !  It must have been a big washing ,"	1	0
" Then there was young John Howland , who in mid - ocean fell overboard but  was quick enough to catch hold of a trailing rope . Perhaps after dinner  he invited Elizabeth Tilley , whom he afterward married , to sail over to  Clarke 's Island and return by moonlight .  With them , it may be , went John Alden and Priscilla Mullins , whose love  story is so sweetly told by Longfellow .  One proud mother , we may be sure , showed her bright - eyed boy , Peregrine  White .  And so the fun went on . In the daytime the young men ran races , played  games , and had a shooting match . Every night the Indians sang and  danced for their friends ; and to make things still more lively they  gave every now and then a shrill war whoop that made the woods echo in  the still night air .  The Indians had already learned to love and fear Captain Miles  Standish . Some of them called him "" Boiling Water "" because he was easily  made angry . Others called him "" Captain Shrimp , "" on account of his small  size .  Every morning the shrewd captain put on his armour and paraded his  little company of a dozen or more soldiers ; and when he fired off the  cannon on Burial Hill the Indians must have felt that the English were  men of might thus to harness up thunder and lightning .  During this week of fun and frolic it was a wonder if young Jack  Billington did not play some prank on the Indians . He was the boy who  fired off his father 's gun one day , close to a keg of gunpowder , in the  crowded cabin of the _ Mayflower _ .  The third day came . Massasoit had been well treated , and no doubt would  have liked to stay longer , but he had said he could stay only three  days . So the pipe of peace was silently passed around .  Then , taking their presents of glass beads and trinkets , the Indian  king and his warriors said farewell to their English friends and began  their long tramp through the woods to their wigwams on Mount Hope Bay .  On the last day of this Thanksgiving party the Pilgrims had a service  of prayer and praise . Elder Brewster preached the first Thanksgiving  sermon . After thanking God for all his goodness , he did not forget the  many loved ones sleeping on the hillside .  He spoke of noble John Carver , the first governor , who had died of  worry and overwork .  Nor was Rose Standish forgotten , the"	1	0
" The first Thanksgiving took place nearly three hundred years ago . Since  that time , almost without interruption , Thanksgiving has been kept by  the people of New England as the great family festival of the year . At  this time children and grandchildren return to the old home , the long  table is spread , and brothers and sisters , separated often by many  miles , again sit side by side .  To - day Thanksgiving is observed in nearly all the states of the Union ,  a season of sweet and blessed memories .  THANKSGIVING AT TODD 'S ASYLUM      Many a chuckle lies in wait for the reader in the pages      of this story . And the humour is of the sweet , mellow      sort that sometimes brings moisture to the eyes as well      as laughter to the lips .  PEOPLE said that if it had not been for that annuity Eph Todd would  have been at the poor farm himself instead of setting up a rival to  it ; but there _ was _ the annuity , and that was the beginning of Todd 's  asylum .  No matter who or what you were , if you were in hard luck , Todd 's asylum  was open to you . The No . 4 district schoolhouse clock was a sample . For  thirty years it had smiled from the wall upon successive generations  of scholars , until , one day , bowed with years and infirmities , it had  ceased to tick . It had been taken gently down , laid out on a desk in  state for a day or two , and finally was in funeral procession to the  rubbish heap when Eph Todd appeared .  "" You 're not going to throw that good old clock away ? "" Eph had asked of  the committeeman who acted as bearer .  "" Guess I 'll have to , "" replied the other . "" I 've wound it up tight , put  ' most a pint of kerosene in it , and shook it till I 'm dizzy , and it  wo n't tick a bit . Guess the old clock 's done for . ""  "" Now see here , "" said Eph ; "" you just let me have a try at it . Let me  take it home a spell . ""  "" Oh , for that matter I 'll give it to you , "" the committeeman replied .  "" We 've bought another for the schoolhouse . ""  A day or two after the old clock ticked away as soberly as ever on the  wall of the Todd kitchen .  "" Took it home and boiled it in potash , "" Eph used to"	1	0
" "" It was n't much of a job , "" as Eph said , "" to reach up once an hour and  send the hand along one space , and Aunt Tildy had to have something to  look forward to . ""  Aunt Tildy was the first inmate at Todd 's , and if Eph had possessed no  other recommendation to eternal beatitude , surely Aunt Tildy 's prayers  had been sufficient . She passed his house on her way to the poor farm  on the very day that news of the legacy arrived , and Eph had stopped  the carriage and begged the overseer to leave her with him .  "" Are you sure you can take care of her ? "" asked the overseer , doubtfully .  "" Sure ? "" echoed Eph with delight . "" Of course I 'm sure . Ai n't I got four  hundred dollars a year for the rest of my natural born days ? ""  "" He 's a good fellow , Eph Todd , "" mused the overseer as he drove away ,  "" but I never heard of his having any money . ""  Next day the news of the legacy was common property , and Aunt Tildy had  been an inmate at Todd 's ever since . Her gratitude knew no bounds , and  she really managed to keep the house after a fashion , her chief care  being the clock .  Then there was the heaven - born inventor . He had dissipated his  substance in inventing an incubator that worked with wonderful success  till the day the chickens were to come out , when it took fire and  burned up , taking with it chickens , barn , house , and furniture , leaving  the heaven - born inventor standing in the field , thinly clad , and with  nothing left in the world but another incubator .  With this he had shown up promptly at Todd 's , and there he had dwelt  thenceforth , using a pretty fair portion of the annuity in further  incubator experiments .  With excellent sagacity , for him , Eph had obliged the heaven - born  inventor to keep his machine in a little shed behind the barn , so that  when this one burned up there was time to get the horse and cow out  before the barn burned , and the village fire department managed to  save the house . Repairing this loss made quite a hole in the annuity ,  and all the heaven - born inventor had to show for it was Miltiades . He  had put a single turkey 's egg in with a previous hatch , and though he  had raised nary chicken , and it was contrary to"	1	0
"He took care of himself , was never  shut up nor handled , and led a wild , nomadic life .  Last of all came Fisherman Jones . He was old now and could n't see very  well , unable to go to the brook or pond to fish , but he still started  out daily with the fine new rod and reel which the annuity had bought  for him , and would sit out in the sun , joint his rod together , and fish  in the dry pasture with perfect contentment .  You would not think Fisherman Jones of much use , but it was he who  caught Miltiades and made the Thanksgiving dinner possible .  The new barn had exhausted the revenues completely , and there would  be no more income until January 1st ; but one must have a turkey for  Thanksgiving , and there was Miltiades . To catch Miltiades became the  household problem , and the heaven - born inventor set wonderful traps for  him , which caught almost everything but Miltiades , who easily avoided  them . Eph used to go out daily before breakfast and chase Miltiades ,  but he might as well have chased a government position . The turkey  scorned him , and grew only wilder and tougher , till he had a lean and  hungry look that would have shamed Cassius .  The day before Thanksgiving it looked as if there would be no turkey  dinner at Todd 's , but here Fisherman Jones stepped into the breach . It  was a beautiful Indian - summer day , and he hobbled out into the field  for an afternoon 's fishing . Here he sat on a log , and began to make  casts in the open . Nearby , under a savin bush , lurked Miltiades , and  viewed these actions with the scorn of long familiarity . By and by  Fisherman Jones kicked up a loose bit of bark , and disclosed beneath  it a fine fat white grub , of the sort which blossoms into June beetles  with the coming of spring . He was not so blind but that he saw this ,  and with a chuckle at the thoughts it called up , he baited his hook  with it .  A moment after , Eph Todd , coming out of the new barn , heard the click  of a reel , and was astonished to see Fisherman Jones standing almost  erect , his eyes blazing with the old - time fire , his rod bent , his reel  buzzing , while at the end of a good forty feet of line was Miltiades  rushing in frantic strides for the woods .  "" Good land ! "" said Eph ; "" it"	1	0
" "" Eph Todd ! "" gasped Fisherman Jones , "" this is the whoppingest old bass  I ever hooked onto yet . Beeswax , how he does pull ! "" And with the words  Fisherman Jones went backward over the log , waving the pole and a pair  of stiff legs in air . The turkey had suddenly slackened the line .  "" Give him the butt ! Give him the butt ! "" roared Eph , rushing up . Even  where he lay the fisherman blood in Fisherman Jones responded to this  stirring appeal , and as the rod bent in a tense half circle a race  began such as no elderly fisherman was ever the centre of before .  Round and round went Miltiades , with the white grub in his crop , and  the line above it gripped tightly in his strong beak ; and round and  round went Eph Todd , his outstretched arms waving like the turkey 's  wings , and his big boots denting the soft pasture turf with the vigour  of his gallop . In the centre Fisherman Jones , too nearsighted to see  what he had hooked , had risen on one knee , and revolved with the  coursing bird , his soul wrapped in one idea : to keep the butt of his  rod aimed at the whirling game .  "" Hang to him ! Reel him in ! We 'll get him ! "" shouted Eph ; and , with the  word , he caught his toe and vanished into the prickly depths of the  savin bush , just as the heaven - born inventor came over the hill . It  would be interesting to know just what scheme the heaven - born inventor  would have put in motion for the capture of Miltiades , but just then he  stepped into one of his own extraordinary traps , set for the turkey  of course , and , with one foot held fast , began to flounder about with  cries of rage and dismay .  This brought Eph 's head above the fringe of savin bush again , and now  he beheld a wonderful sight . Fisherman Jones was again on his feet ,  staring in wild surprise at Miltiades , whom he sighted for the first  time , within ten feet of him . There was no pressure on the reel , and  Miltiades was swallowing the line in big gulps , evidently determined to  have not only the white grub , but all that went with it .  Fisherman Jones 's cry of dismay was almost as bitter as that of the  heaven - born inventor , who still writhed in his own trap .  "" Oh , Eph ! Eph ! "" he whimpered ,"	1	0
"Eph scrambled out of his bush ,  and , taking up the chase once more , soon brought it to an end , for  Fisherman Jones , his nerve completely gone , could only stand and mumble  sadly to himself , "" He 's eating up my tackle ! He 's eating up my tackle ! ""  and the line , wrapping about his motionless form , led Eph and the  turkey in a brief spiral which ended in the conjunction of the three .  It was not until the turkey was decapitated that Eph remembered the  heaven - born inventor and hastened to his rescue . He was still in the  trap , but he was quite content , for he was figuring out a plan for  an automatic release from the same , something which should hold the  captive so long and then let him go in the interests of humanity . He  found the trap from the captive 's point of view very interesting and  instructive .  The tenacity of Miltiades 's make - up was further shown by the difficulty  Eph and Fisherman Jones had in separating him from his feathers that  evening ; and Aunt Tildy was so interested in the project of the  heaven - born inventor to raise featherless turkeys that she forgot the  yeast cake she had put to soak until it had been boiling merrily for  some time . Everything seemed to go wrong - end - to , and they all sat up  so late that Mrs. Simpkins , across the way , was led to observe that  "" Either some one was dead over at Todd 's or else they were having a  family party "" ; and in a certain sense she was right both ways .  The crowning misadventure came next morning . Eph started for the  village with his mind full of commissions from Aunt Tildy , some of  which he was sure to forget , and in a great hurry lest he forget them  all . He threw the harness hastily upon Dobbin , hitched him into the  wagon which had stood out on the soft ground overnight , and with an  eager "" Get up , there ! "" gave him a slap with the reins .  Next moment there was a ripping sound , and the heaven - born inventor  came to the door just in time to see the horse going out of the yard  on a run , with Eph following , still clinging to the reins , and taking  strides much like those of Baron Munchausen 's courier .  "" Here , here ! "" called the inventor , "" you 've forgot the wagon . Come back ,  Eph ! You 've forgot the wagon !"	1	0
" But when he reached the barn he saw  the trouble . The ground had frozen hard overnight , and the wagon  wheels sunken in it were held as in a vise . Eph had started the horse  suddenly , and the obedient animal had walked right out of the shafts ,  harness and all .  A half hour later Eph was back with Dobbin , unharmed but a trifle  weary . It took an hour more and all Aunt Tildy 's hot water to thaw out  the wheels , and when it was done Eph was so confused that he drove to  the village and back and forgot every one of his commissions . And in  the midst of all this the clock stopped . That settled the matter for  Aunt Tildy . She neglected the pudding , she forgot the pies , and she let  the turkey bake and bake in the overheated oven while she fretted about  that clock ; and when it was finally set going , after long and careful  investigation by Eph , and frantic but successful attempts on the part  of Aunt Tildy to keep the heaven - born inventor from ruining it forever ,  it was the dinner hour .  Poor Aunt Tildy ! That dinner was the crowning sorrow of her life . The  vegetables were cooked to rags , the pies were charcoal shells , and  the pudding had not been made . As for Miltiades , he was ten times  tougher than in life , and Eph 's carving knife slipped from his form  without making a dent . Aunt Tildy wept at this , and Fisherman Jones  and the inventor looked blank enough , but there was no sorrow in the  countenance of Eph . He cheered Aunt Tildy , and he cracked jokes that  made even Fisherman Jones laugh .   Why , bless you ! "" he said , "" ever since I was a boy I 've been looking  for a chance to make a Thanksgiving dinner out of bread and milk . And  now I 've got it . Why , I would n't have missed this for anything ! "" And  there came a knock at the door .  Even Eph looked a trifle blank at this . If it should be company ! "" Come  in ! "" he called .  The door was pushed aside and a big , steaming platter entered . It was  upheld by a small boy , who stammered diffidently , "" My moth - moth - mother  thaid she wanted you to try thum of her nith turkey . ""  "" Well , well ! "" said Eph ; "" Aunt Tildy has cooked a turkey for us to - day , "	1	0
" "" She thays you c - c - can thend the platter home to - morrow , "" stammered the  boy , and stammering himself out , he ran into another . The other held  high a big dish of plum pudding , from which a spicy aroma filled the  room . Again the heaven - born inventor made signs to Eph .  "" Our folks told me to ask if you would n't try this plum pudding , "" said  the newcomer . "" They made an extra one , and the cousins we expected  did n't come , so we can spare it just as well as not . ""  It seemed as if Eph hesitated a moment , and the inventor 's face became  a panorama . Then he took the boy by the hand , and there was an odd  shake in his voice as he said :  "" I 'm greatly obliged to you . We all are . Something happened to our plum  pudding , and we did n't have any . Tell your ma we send our thanks . ""  There was a sound of voices greeting in the hallway , and two young  girls entered , each laden with a basket .  "" Oh , Mr. Todd , "" they both said at once , "" we could n't wait to knock . We  want you to try some of our Thanksgiving . It was mother 's birthday , and  we cooked extra for that , and we 've got so much . We ca n't get all ours  onto the table . She 'll feel real hurt if you do n't . ""  Somehow Eph could n't say a word , but there was nothing the matter with  the heaven - born inventor . His speech of delighted acceptance was such  a good one that before he was half done the girls had loaded the table  with good things , and , with smiles and nods and "" good - byes , "" slipped  out as rapidly and as gayly as they had come in . It was like a gust of  wind from a summer garden .  The table , but now so bare , fairly sagged and steamed with offerings of  Thanksgiving . Somehow the steam got into Eph 's eyes and made them wet ,  till all he could do was to say whimsically :  "" There goes my last chance at a bread - and - milk Thanksgiving . ""  But now Aunt Tildy had the floor , with her faded face all alight .  "" Eph Todd , "" she said , "" you need n't look so flustrated . It 's nothing  more than you deserve and not half so much either . Ai"	1	0
" "" Jeddediah Jodkins ! "" he said ; "" if that is any more people bringing  things to eat to this house , they 'll have to go away . We ca n't have it .  We 've got enough here now to feed a -- a boarding school . ""  The heaven - born inventor sprang eagerly to his feet . "" Do n't you do it ,  Eph , "" he said , "" do n't you do it . I 've just thought of a way to can it . ""  A thinly clad man and woman stood at the door which Eph opened . Both  looked pale and tired , and the woman shivered .  "" Can you tell me where I can get work , "" asked the man , doggedly , "" so  that I can earn a little something to eat ? We are not beggars""--he  flushed a little through his pallor--""but I have had no work lately ,  and we have eaten nothing since yesterday . We are looking---- ""  The man stopped , and well he might , for Eph was dancing wildly about  the two , and hustling them into the house .  "" Come in ! "" he shouted . "" Come in ! Come in ! You 're the folks we are  waiting for ! Eat ? Why , goodness gra - cious ! We 've got so much to eat we  do n't know what to do with it . ""  He had them in chairs in a moment and was piling steaming roast turkey  on their plates . "" There ! "" he said , "" do n't you say another word till you  have filled up on that . Folks""--and he returned to the others--""here 's  two friends that have come to stay a week with us and help eat turkey .  Fall to ! This is going to be the pleasantest Thanksgiving we 've had  yet . ""  And thus two new inmates were added to Todd 's asylum .  HOW WE KEPT THANKSGIVING AT OLDTOWN  BY HARRIET BEECHER STOWE .      The old - time New England Thanksgiving has been      described many times , but never better then by the      author of "" Uncle Tom 's Cabin "" in her less successful      but more artistic novel , "" Oldtown Folks , "" from which      book the following narrative has been adapted .  WHEN the apples were all gathered and the cider was all made , and the  yellow pumpkins were rolled in from many a hill in billows of gold ,  and the corn was husked , and the labours of the season were done , and  the warm , late days of Indian summer came in , dreamy and"	1	0
"New modes of  elaborating squash pies and quince tarts were now ofttimes carefully  discussed at the evening firesides by Aunt Lois and Aunt Keziah , and  notes seriously compared with the experiences of certain other aunties  of high repute in such matters . I noticed that on these occasions  their voices often fell into mysterious whispers , and that receipts  of especial power and sanctity were communicated in tones so low  as entirely to escape the vulgar ear . I still remember the solemn  shake of the head with which my Aunt Lois conveyed to Miss Mehitable  Rossiter the critical properties of _ mace _ , in relation to its powers  of producing in corn fritters a suggestive resemblance to oysters . As  ours was an oyster - getting district , and as that charming bivalve was  perfectly easy to come at , the interest of such an imitation can be  accounted for only by the fondness of the human mind for works of art .  For as much as a week beforehand , "" we children "" were employed in  chopping mince for pies to a most wearisome fineness , and in pounding  cinnamon , allspice , and cloves in a great lignum - vit√¶ mortar ; and the  sound of this pounding and chopping re√´choed through all the rafters of  the old house with a hearty and vigorous cheer most refreshing to our  spirits .  In those days there were none of the thousand ameliorations of the  labours of housekeeping which have since arisen -- no ground and prepared  spices and sweet herbs ; everything came into our hands in the rough ,  and in bulk , and the reducing of it into a state for use was deemed one  of the appropriate labours of childhood . Even the very salt that we  used in cooking was rock salt , which we were required to wash and dry  and pound and sift before it became fit for use .  At other times of the year we sometimes murmured at these labours , but  those that were supposed to usher in the great Thanksgiving festival  were always entered into with enthusiasm . There were signs of richness  all around us -- stoning of raisins , cutting of citron , slicing of  candied orange peel . Yet all these were only dawnings and intimations  of what was coming during the week of real preparation , after the  Governor 's proclamation had been read .  The glories of that proclamation ! We knew beforehand the Sunday it was  to be read , and walked to church with alacrity , filled with gorgeous  and vague expectations .  The cheering anticipation sustained us through what seemed to us the  long waste of the sermon and"	1	0
"That great sheet of paper impressed  us as something supernatural , by reason of its mighty size and by the  broad seal of the State affixed thereto ; and when the minister read  therefrom , "" By his Excellency , the Governor of the Commonwealth of  Massachusetts , a Proclamation , "" our mirth was with difficulty repressed  by admonitory glances from our sympathetic elders . Then , after a solemn  enumeration of the benefits which the Commonwealth had that year  received at the hands of Divine Providence , came at last the naming  of the eventful day , and , at the end of all , the imposing heraldic  words , "" God save the Commonwealth of Massachusetts . "" And then , as the  congregation broke up and dispersed , all went their several ways with  schemes of mirth and feasting in their heads .  And now came on the week in earnest . In the very watches of the night  preceding Monday morning a preternatural stir below stairs and the  thunder of the pounding barrel announced that the washing was to be got  out of the way before daylight , so as to give "" ample scope and room  enough "" for the more pleasing duties of the season .  The making of _ pies _ at this period assumed vast proportions that  verged upon the sublime . Pies were made by forties and fifties and  hundreds , and made of everything on the earth and under the earth .  The pie is an English institution , which , planted on American soil ,  forthwith ran rampant and burst forth into an untold variety of genera  and species . Not merely the old traditional mince pie , but a thousand  strictly American seedlings from that main stock , evinced the power  of American housewives to adapt old institutions to new uses . Pumpkin  pies , cranberry pies , huckleberry pies , cherry pies , green - currant  pies , peach , pear , and plum pies , custard pies , apple pies ,  Marlborough - pudding pies -- pies with top crusts and pies without -- pies  adorned with all sorts of fanciful flutings and architectural strips  laid across and around , and otherwise varied , attested the boundless  fertility of the feminine mind when once let loose in a given direction .  Fancy the heat and vigour of the great pan formation , when Aunt Lois  and Aunt Keziah , and my mother and grandmother , all in ecstasies of  creative inspiration , ran , bustled , and hurried -- mixing , rolling ,  tasting , consulting -- alternately setting us children to work when  anything could be made of us , and then chasing us all out of the "	1	0
" On these occasions , as there was a great looseness in the police  department over us children , we usually found a ready refuge at Miss  Mehitable 's with Tina,[8 ] who , confident of the strength of her  position with Polly , invited us into the kitchen , and with the air of a  mistress led us around to view the proceedings there .  A genius for entertaining was one of Tina 's principal characteristics ;  and she did not fail to make free with raisins , or citrons , or whatever  came to hand , in a spirit of hospitality at which Polly seriously  demurred . That worthy woman occasionally felt the inconvenience of  the state of subjugation to which the little elf had somehow or other  reduced her , and sometimes rattled her chains fiercely , scolding with  a vigour which rather alarmed us , but which Tina minded not a whit .  Confident of her own powers , she would , in the very midst of her wrath ,  mimic her to her face with such irresistible drollery as to cause  the torrent of reproof to end in a dissonant laugh , accompanied by a  submissive cry for quarter .  "" I declare , Tina Percival , "" she said to her one day , "" you 're saucy  enough to physic a horn bug ! I never did see the beater of you ! If Miss  Mehitable do n't keep you in better order , I do n't see what 's to become  of any of us ! ""  "" Why , what did ' come of you before I came ? "" was the undismayed reply .  "" You know , Polly , you and Aunty both were just as lonesome as you could  be till I came here , and you never had such pleasant times in your life  as you 've had since I 've been here . You 're a couple of old beauties ,  both of you , and know just how to get along with me . But come , boys ,  let 's take our raisins and go up into the garret and play Thanksgiving . ""  In the corner of the great kitchen , during all these days , the jolly  old oven roared and crackled in great volcanic billows of flame ,  snapping and gurgling as if the old fellow entered with joyful sympathy  into the frolic of the hour ; and then , his great heart being once  warmed up , he brooded over successive generations of pies and cakes ,  which went in raw and came out cooked , till butteries and dressers and  shelves and pantries were literally crowded with a jostling abundance .

" During this eventful preparation week all the female part of my  grandmother 's household , as I have before remarked , were at a height  above any ordinary state of mind ; they moved about the house rapt in  a species of prophetic frenzy . It seemed to be considered a necessary  feature of such festivals that everybody should be in a hurry ,  and everything in the house should be turned bottom upwards with  enthusiasm -- so at least we children understood it , and we certainly  did our part to keep the ball rolling .  At this period the constitutional activity of Uncle Fliakim increased  to a degree that might fairly be called preternatural . Thanksgiving  time was the time for errands of mercy and beneficence through the  country ; and Uncle Fliakim 's immortal old rubber horse and rattling  wagon were on the full jump in tours of investigation into everybody 's  affairs in the region around . On returning , he would fly through our  kitchen like the wind , leaving open the doors , upsetting whatever  came in his way -- now a pan of milk , and now a basin of mince -- talking  rapidly , and forgetting only the point in every case that gave it  significance , or enabled any one to put it to any sort of use . When  Aunt Lois checked his benevolent effusions by putting the test  questions of practical efficiency , Uncle Fliakim always remembered  that he 'd "" forgotten to inquire about that , "" and skipping through the  kitchen , and springing into his old wagon , would rattle off again on a  full tilt to correct and amend his investigations .  Moreover , my grandmother 's kitchen at this time began to be haunted by  those occasional hangers - on and retainers , of uncertain fortunes , whom  a full experience of her bountiful habits led to expect something at  her hand at this time of the year . All the poor , loafing tribes , Indian  and half - Indian , who at other times wandered , selling baskets and  other light wares , were sure to come back to Oldtown a little before  Thanksgiving time , and report themselves in my grandmother 's kitchen .  The great hogshead of cider in the cellar , which my grandfather called  the Indian hogshead , was on tap at all hours of the day ; and many  a mugful did I draw and dispense to the tribes that basked in the  sunshine at our door .  Aunt Lois never had a hearty conviction of the propriety of these  arrangements ; but my grandmother , who had a prodigious verbal memory ,  bore down upon her with such strings"	1	0
"That 's just  mother 's way ; she always keeps a whole generation at her heels . ""  "" How many times must I tell you , Lois , to read your Bible ? "" was my  grandmother 's rejoinder ; and loud over the sound of pounding and  chopping in the kitchen could be heard the voice of her quotations : "" If  there be among you a poor man in any of the gates of the land which the  Lord thy God giveth thee , thou shalt not harden thy heart , nor shut thy  hand , from thy poor brother . Thou shalt surely give him ; and thy heart  shall not be grieved when thou givest to him , because that for this  thing the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all thy works ; for the poor  shall never cease from out of the land . ""  These words seemed to resound like a sort of heraldic proclamation to  call around us all that softly shiftless class , who , for some reason or  other , are never to be found with anything in hand at the moment that  it is wanted .  "" There , to be sure , "" said Aunt Lois , one day when our preparations were  in full blast ; "" there comes Sam Lawson down the hill , limpsy as ever ;  now he 'll have his doleful story to tell , and mother'll give him one of  the turkeys . ""  And so , of course , it fell out .  Sam came in with his usual air of plaintive assurance , and seated  himself a contemplative spectator in the chimney corner , regardless of  the looks and signs of unwelcome on the part of Aunt Lois .  "" Lordy massy , how prosperous everything does seem here ! "" he said in  musing tones , over his inevitable mug of cider ; "" so different from what  ' tis t ' our house . There 's Hepsey , she 's all in a stew , an ' I 've just  been an ' got her thirty - seven cents ' wuth o ' nutmegs , yet she says  she 's sure she do n't see how she 's to keep Thanksgiving , an ' she 's  down on me about it , just as ef ' twas my fault . Yeh see , last winter  our old gobbler got froze . You know , Mis ' Badger , that ' ere cold night  we he d last winter . Wal , I was off with Jake Marshall that night ; ye  see , Jake , he had to take old General Dearborn 's corpse into Boston ,  to the family vault , and Jake"	1	0
"Wal , did n't hurt  him none , poor man ; ' twas allers a favourite spot o ' his'n . But , takin '  one thing with another , I did n't get home till about noon next day ,  an ' I tell you , Hepsey she was right down on me . She said the baby  was sick , and there had n't been no wood split , nor the barn fastened  up , nor nuthin' . Lordy massy , I did n't mean no harm ; I thought there  was wood enough , and I thought likely Hepsey'd git out an ' fasten up  the barn . But Hepsey , she was in one o ' her contrary streaks , an ' she  would n't do a thing ; an ' when I went out to look , why , sure 'nuff ,  there was our old tom - turkey froze as stiff as a stake -- his claws jist  a stickin ' right straight up like this . "" Here Sam struck an expressive  attitude , and looked so much like a frozen turkey as to give a pathetic  reality to the picture .  "" Well , now , Sam , why need you be off on things that 's none of your  business ? "" said my grandmother . "" I 've talked to you plainly about that  a great many times , Sam , "" she continued , in tones of severe admonition .  "" Hepsey is a hard - working woman , but she ca n't be expected to see to  everything , and you oughter ' ave been at home that night to fasten up  your own barn and look after your own creeturs . ""  Sam took the rebuke all the more meekly as he perceived the stiff black  legs of a turkey poking out from under my grandmother 's apron while she  was delivering it . To be exhorted and told of his shortcomings , and  then furnished with a turkey at Thanksgiving , was a yearly part of his  family program . In time he departed , not only with the turkey , but with  us boys in procession after him , bearing a mince and a pumpkin pie for  Hepsey 's children .  "" Poor things ! "" my grandmother remarked ; "" they ought to have something  good to eat Thanksgiving Day ; ' tain't their fault that they 've got a  shiftless father . ""  Sam , in his turn , moralized to us children , as we walked beside him :  "" A body'd think that Hepsey'd learn to trust in Providence , "" he said ,  "" but she do n't . She allers has a Thanksgiving dinner pervided ; but that"	1	0
"Folks doos lose so much that he s sech  dispositions . ""  A multitude of similar dispensations during the course of the week  materially reduced the great pile of chickens and turkeys which black  C√¶sar 's efforts in slaughtering , picking , and dressing kept daily  supplied ....         *        *        *        *        *  Great as the preparations were for the dinner , everything was so  contrived that not a soul in the house should be kept from the morning  service of Thanksgiving in the church , and from listening to the  Thanksgiving sermon , in which the minister was expected to express his  views freely concerning the politics of the country and the state of  things in society generally , in a somewhat more secular vein of thought  than was deemed exactly appropriate to the Lord 's day . But it is to be  confessed that , when the good man got carried away by the enthusiasm  of his subject to extend these exercises beyond a certain length ,  anxious glances , exchanged between good wives , sometimes indicated a  weakness of the flesh , having a tender reference to the turkeys and  chickens and chicken pies which might possibly be overdoing in the  ovens at home . But your old brick oven was a true Puritan institution ,  and backed up the devotional habits of good housewives by the capital  care which he took of whatever was committed to his capacious bosom . A  truly well - bred oven would have been ashamed of himself all his days  and blushed redder than his own fires , if a God - fearing house matron ,  away at the temple of the Lord , should come home and find her pie crust  either burned or underdone by his over or under zeal ; so the old fellow  generally managed to bring things out exactly right .  When sermons and prayers were all over , we children rushed home to see  the great feast of the year spread .  What chitterings and chatterings there were all over the house , as all  the aunties and uncles and cousins came pouring in , taking off their  things , looking at one another 's bonnets and dresses , and mingling  their comments on the morning sermon with various opinions on the new  millinery outfits , and with bits of home news and kindly neighbourhood  gossip .  Uncle Bill , whom the Cambridge college authorities released , as they  did all the other youngsters of the land , for Thanksgiving Day , made a  breezy stir among them all , especially with the young cousins of the  feminine gender .  The best room on this occasion was thrown wide open , and"	1	0
"But on  Thanksgiving Day , at least , every year this marvel was effected in our  best room .  Although all servile labour and vain recreation on this day were by  law forbidden , according to the terms of the proclamation , it was not  held to be a violation of the precept that all the nice old aunties  should bring their knitting work and sit gently trotting their needles  around the fire ; nor that Uncle Bill should start a full - fledged romp  among the girls and children , while the dinner was being set on the  long table in the neighbouring kitchen . Certain of the good elderly  female relatives , of serious and discreet demeanour , assisted at this  operation .  But who shall do justice to the dinner , and describe the turkey , and  chickens , and chicken pies , with all that endless variety of vegetables  which the American soil and climate have contributed to the table ,  and which , without regard to the French doctrine of courses , were  all piled together in jovial abundance upon the smoking board ? There  was much carving and laughing and talking and eating , and all showed  that cheerful ability to despatch the provisions which was the ruling  spirit of the hour . After the meat came the plum puddings , and then the  endless array of pies , till human nature was actually bewildered and  overpowered by the tempting variety ; and even we children turned from  the profusion offered to us , and wondered what was the matter that we  could eat no more .  When all was over , my grandfather rose at the head of the table , and  a fine venerable picture he made as he stood there , his silver hair  flowing in curls down each side of his clear , calm face , while , in  conformity to the old Puritan custom , he called their attention to a  recital of the mercies of God in His dealings with their family .  It was a sort of family history , going over and touching upon the  various events which had happened . He spoke of my father 's death , and  gave a tribute to his memory ; and closed all with the application of  a time - honoured text , expressing the hope that as years passed by we  might "" so number our days as to apply our hearts unto wisdom "" ; and  then he gave out that psalm which in those days might be called the  national hymn of the Puritans .      "" Let children hear the mighty deeds         Which God performed of old ,       Which in our younger years we saw ,         And"	1	0
"      And we 'll convey his wonders down         Through every rising race .      "" Our lips shall tell them to our sons ,         And they again to theirs ;       That generations yet unborn         May teach them to their heirs .      "" Thus shall they learn in God alone         Their hope securely stands ;       That they may ne'er forget his works ,         But practise his commands . ""  This we all united in singing to the venerable tune of St. Martin 's ,  an air which , the reader will perceive , by its multiplicity of quavers  and inflections gave the greatest possible scope to the cracked and  trembling voices of the ancients , who united in it with even more zeal  than the younger part of the community .  Uncle Fliakim Sheril , furbished up in a new crisp black suit , and  with his spindleshanks trimly incased in the smoothest of black silk  stockings , looking for all the world just like an alert and spirited  black cricket , outdid himself on this occasion in singing _ counter _ , in  that high , weird voice that he must have learned from the wintry winds  that usually piped around the corners of the old house . But any one  who looked at him , as he sat with his eyes closed , beating time with  head and hand , and , in short , with every limb of his body , must have  perceived the exquisite satisfaction which he derived from this mode  of expressing himself . I much regret to be obliged to state that my  graceless Uncle Bill , taking advantage of the fact that the eyes of all  his elders were devotionally closed , stationing himself a little in the  rear of my Uncle Fliakim , performed an exact imitation of his _ counter _  with such a killing facility that all the younger part of the audience  were nearly dead with suppressed laughter . Aunt Lois , who never shut  her eyes a moment on any occasion , discerned this from a distant part  of the room , and in vain endeavoured to stop it by vigorously shaking  her head at the offender . She might as well have shaken it at a  bobolink tilting on a clover top . In fact , Uncle Bill was Aunt Lois 's  weak point , and the corners of her own mouth were observed to twitch in  such a suspicious manner that the whole moral force of her admonition  was destroyed .  And now , the dinner being cleared away , we youngsters , already  excited to a tumult of laughter , tumbled into the best room , under  the supervision of Uncle Bill , to relieve ourselves with"	1	0
"It was understood that we were to have a dance , and  black C√¶sar , full of turkey and pumpkin pie , and giggling in the very  jollity of his heart , had that afternoon rosined his bow , and tuned his  fiddle , and practised jigs and Virginia reels , in a way that made us  children think him a perfect Orpheus ....  You may imagine the astounding wassail among the young people .... My  Uncle Bill related the story of "" the Wry - mouth Family , "" with such  twists and contortions and killing extremes of the ludicrous as  perfectly overcame even the minister ; and he was to be seen , at one  period of the evening , with a face purple with laughter and the tears  actually rolling down over his well - formed cheeks , while some of the  more excitable young people almost fell in trances and rolled on the  floor in the extreme of their merriment . In fact , the assemblage was  becoming so tumultuous , that the scrape of C√¶sar 's violin and the  forming of sets for a dance seemed necessary to restore the peace ....  Uncle Bill would insist on leading out Aunt Lois , and the bright  colour rising to her thin cheeks brought back a fluttering image of  what might have been beauty in some fresh , early day . Ellery Davenport  insisted upon leading forth Miss Deborah Kittery , notwithstanding her  oft - repeated refusals and earnest protestations to the contrary . As  to Uncle Fliakim , he jumped and frisked and gyrated among the single  sisters and maiden aunts , whirling them into the dance as if he had  been the little black gentleman himself . With that true spirit of  Christian charity which marked all his actions , he invariably chose out  the homeliest and most neglected , and thus worthy Aunt Keziah , dear old  soul , was for a time made quite prominent by his attentions ....  Grandmother 's face was radiant with satisfaction , as the wave of  joyousness crept up higher and higher round her , till the elders , who  stood keeping time with their heads and feet , began to tell one another  how they had danced with their sweethearts in good old days gone by ,  and the elder women began to blush and bridle , and boast of steps that  they could take in their youth , till the music finally subdued them ,  and into the dance they went .  "" Well , well ! "" quoth my grandmother ; "" they 're all at it so hearty I  do n't see why I should n't try it myself . "" And into the Virginia reel  she went ,"	1	0
" "" Why should n't I dance ? "" she said , when she arrived red and resplendent  at the bottom of the set . "" Did n't Mr. Despondency and Miss Muchafraid  and Mr. Readytohalt all dance together in the ' Pilgrim 's Progress ? ' ""  And the minister in his ample flowing wig , and my lady in her stiff  brocade , gave to my grandmother a solemn twinkle of approbation .  As nine o'clock struck , the whole scene dissolved and melted ; for what  well - regulated village would think of carrying festivities beyond that  hour ?  And so ended our Thanksgiving at Oldtown .  WISHBONE VALLEY      A Thanksgiving ghost story about a boy who dined not      wisely but too well .  THE Thanksgiving feast had just ended , and only Donald and his little  sister Grace remained at the table , looking drowsily at the plum  pudding that they could n't finish , but which they disliked to leave on  their plates .  When the plates had been removed , and the plum - pudding taken to the  kitchen and placed beside the well - carved gobbler , Donald and Grace  were too tired to rise from their chairs to have their faces washed .  They seemed lost in a roseate repose , until Grace finally thought of  the wishbone that they intended to break after dinner .  "" Come , now , Donald , "" she said , "" let 's break the old gobbler 's wishbone . ""  "" All right , "" replied Donald , opening his eyes slowly , and unwrapping  the draperies of his sweet plum - pudding dreams from about him , "" let 's  do it now . "" So he held up the wishbone , and Grace took hold of the  other end of it with a merry laugh .  "" Here , you must not take hold so far from the end , because I have a  fine wish to make , and want to get the big half if possible . ""  "" So have I a nice wish to make , "" replied Grace , with a sigh , "" and I  also want the big end . ""  And so they argued for a few minutes , until their mother entered the  room and told them that if they could not stop quarrelling over the  wishbone she would take it from them and throw it into the fire . So  they lost no time in taking it by the ends and snapping it asunder .  "" Hurrah ! "" exclaimed Donald , observing Grace 's expression of  disappointment . "" I 've got it ! ""  "" Well , I 've made a wish , too"	1	0
"  And then Donald thought he would go out in the air and play , because  his great dinner made him feel very uncomfortable . When he was out  in the barnyard it was just growing dusk , and Donald , through his  half - closed eyes , observed a gobbler strutting about . To his great  surprise the gobbler approached him instead of running away .   I thought we had you for dinner to - day , "" said Donald .  "" You did , "" replied the gobbler coldly , "" and you had a fine old time ,  did n't you ? ""  "" Yes , "" said Donald , "" you made a splendid dinner , and you ought to be  pleased to think you made us all so happy . Your second joints were  very sweet and juicy , and your drumsticks were like sticks of candy . ""  "" And you broke my poor old wishbone with your little sister , did n't  you ? ""  "" I did . ""  "" And what did you wish ? "" asked the gobbler .  "" You must n't ask me that , "" replied Donald , "" because , you know , if I  tell you the wish I made it would not come true . ""  "" But it was my wishbone , "" persisted the gobbler , "" and I think I ought  to know something about it . ""  "" You have rights , I suppose , and your argument is not without force , ""  replied Donald , with calm dignity .  The gobbler was puzzled at so lofty a reply , and not understanding it ,  said :  "" I am only the ghost , or spirit , of the gobbler you ate to - day , but  still I remember how one day last summer you threw a pan of water on  me , and alluded to my wattles as a red necktie , and called me ' Old  Harvard . ' Now , come along ! ""  "" Where ? "" asked Donald .  "" To Wishbone Valley , where you will see the spirits of my ancestors  eaten by your family . ""  It was now dusk , and Donald did n't like the idea of going to such a  place . He was a brave , courageous boy , on most occasions , but the idea  of going to Wishbone Valley when the stars were appearing filled him  with a dread that he did n't like to acknowledge even to the ghost of a  gobbler .  "" I ca n't go with you now , Mr. Gobbler , "" he said , "" because I have a lot "	1	0
"  Thereupon the gobbler extended his wing and took Donald by the hand ,  and started on a trot .   Not so fast , "" protested Donald .  "" Why not ? "" demanded the gobbler in surprise .  "" Because , "" replied Donald , with a groan , "" I have just had my dinner ,  and I 'm too full of you to run . ""  So the gobbler kindly and considerately slackened his pace to a walk ,  and the two proceeded out of the barnyard and across a wide meadow to a  little valley surrounded by a dense thicket . The moon was just rising  and the thicket was silvered by its light , while the dry leaves rustled  weirdly in the cold crisp air .  "" This , "" said the gobbler , "" is Wishbone Valley . Look and see . ""  Donald strained his eyes , and , sure enough , there were wishbones  sticking out of the ground in every direction . He thought they looked  like little croquet hoops , but he made no comments , for fear of  offending the old gobbler . But he felt that he must say something to  make the gobbler think that he was not frightened , so he remarked , in  an offhand way :  "" Let 's break one and make a wish . ""  The ghost of the old gobbler frowned , drew himself up , and uttered a  ghostly whistle that seemed to cut the air . As he did so , the ghosts  of the other turkeys long since eaten popped out of the thickets with  a great flapping of wings , and each one perched upon a wishbone and  gazed upon poor Donald , who was so frightened that his collar flew  into a standing position , while he stood upon his toes , with his knees  knocking together at a great rate .  Every turkey fixed its eyes upon the trembling boy , who was beside  himself with fear .  "" What shall we do with him , grandpapa ? "" asked the gobbler of an ancient  bird that could scarcely contain itself and remain on its wishbone .  "" I can not think of anything terrible enough , Willie , "" replied the  grandparent . "" It almost makes my ghostship boil when I think of the way  in which he used to amuse himself by making me a target for his bean  shooter . Often when I was asleep in the button - ball he would fetch me  one on the side of the head that would give me an earache for a week .  But now it is our turn . ""  Here the other turkeys"	1	0
"  Donald was compelled to hand out his bean shooter , and the grandparent  took it , lay on his back , and with the handle of the bean shooter in  one claw and the missile end in the other began to send pebbles at  Donald at a great rate . He could hear them whistling past his ears ,  but could not see them to dodge . Fortunately none struck him , and when  the turkeys felt that they had had fun enough of that kind at his  expense the bean shooter was returned to him .   Now , then , "" said the gobbler 's Aunt Fanny , "" he once gave me a string  of yellow beads for corn . ""  "" What shall we do to him for that ? "" asked the gobbler .  "" Make him eat a lot of yellow beads , "" said the chorus .  "" But we have no beads , "" said the gobbler sadly .  "" Then let 's poke him with a stick , "" suggested the gobbler 's Granduncle  Sylvester ; "" he used to do that to us . ""  So they all took up their wishbones and poked Donald until he was sore .  Sometimes they would hit him in a ticklish spot , and throw him into  such a fit of laughter that they thought he was enjoying it all and  chaffing them . So they stuck their wishbones into the ground , and took  their positions on them once more , to take a needed rest , for the poor  ghosts were greatly exhausted .  There was one quiet turkey who had taken no part in the proceedings .  "" Why do n't you suggest something ? "" demanded Uncle Sylvester .  "" Because , "" replied the quiet turkey , "" Donald never did anything to me ,  and I must treat him accordingly . I was raised and killed a long way  from here , and canned . Donald 's father bought me at a store . To be a  ghost in good standing I should be on the farm where I was killed , and  really I do n't know why I should be here . ""  "" Then you should be an impartial judge , "" said Aunt Fanny . "" Now what  shall we do with him ? ""  "" Tell them to let me go home , "" protested Donald , "" and I 'll agree never  to molest or eat turkey again ; I will give them all the angleworms I  can dig every day , and on Thanksgiving Day I 'll ask my father to have  roast beef . ""  "" I think , "" replied the impartial canned"	1	0
" "" But you could help chasing us around with sticks , "" sang the chorus .  They thereupon descended from the wishbones upon which they had been  perching , and flying after him , they darted the wishbones , which they  held in their beaks , into his back and neck as hard as they could .  Donald ran up and down Wishbone Valley , calling upon them to stop ,  and declaring that if turkey should ever be put upon the table again  he would eat nothing but the stuffing . When Donald found that the  wishbones were sticking into his neck like so many hornet stings , he  made up his mind that he would run for the house . Finally the wishbone  tattoo stopped , and when he looked around , the gobbler , who was twenty  feet away , said : "" When a Thanksgiving turkey dies , his ghost comes  down here to Wishbone Valley to join his ancestors , and it never after  leaves the valley . You will now know why every spring the turkeys steal  down here to hatch their little ones . As you are now over the boundary  line you are safe . ""  "" Thank you , "" said Donald gratefully .  "" Good - bye , "" sang all the ghosts in chorus .  There was then a great ghostly flapping and whistling , and the turkeys  and wishbones all vanished from sight .  Donald ran home as fast as his trembling legs could carry him , and he  fancied that the surviving turkeys on the place made fun of him as he  passed on his way .  When he reached the house he was very happy , but made no allusion to  his experience in Wishbone Valley , for fear of being laughed at .  "" Come , Donald , "" said his mother , shortly after his arrival , "" it is  almost bedtime ; you had better eat that drumstick and retire . ""  "" I think I have had turkey enough for to - day , "" replied Donald , with a  shudder , "" and if it is just the same , I would rather have a nice thick  piece of pumpkin pie . ""  So the girl placed a large piece of pie before him ; and while he was  eating with the keen appetite given him by the crisp air of Wishbone  Valley , he heard a great clattering of hoofs coming down the road .  These sounds did not stop until the express wagon drew up in front of  the house , and the driver brought in a large package for Donald .  "" Hurrah ! "" shouted Donald , in boundless glee . """	1	0
" "" Oh , I knew it all the time ; and my wish came true , too . ""  "" How could your wish come true ? "" asked Donald , with a puzzled look ,  "" when you got the little half of the wishbone ? ""  "" I do n't know , "" replied Grace , "" but my wish did come true . ""  "" And what did you wish ? ""  "" Why , "" said Grace , running up and kissing her little brother  affectionately , "" I wished your wish would come true , of course . ""  PATEM 'S SALMAGUNDI      New York boys , especially , will enjoy this tale of      the doings of a group of Dutch schoolboys in old New      Amsterdam .  LITTLE Patem Onderdonk meant mischief . There was a snap in his eyes  and a look on his face that were certain proof of this . I am bound to  say , however , that there was nothing new or strange in this , for little  Patem Onderdonk generally did mean mischief . Whenever any one 's cow was  found astray beyond the limits , or any one 's bark gutter laid askew  so that the roof - water dripped on the passer 's head , or whenever the  dominie 's dog ran howling down the Heeren Graaft with a battered pypken  cover tied to his suffering tail , the goode vrouws in the neighbourhood  did not stop to wonder who could have done it ; they simply raised both  hands in a sort of injured resignation and exclaimed :  "" _ Ach so _ ; what 's gone of Patem 's Elishamet 's Patem ? ""  So you see little Patem Onderdonk was generally at the bottom of  whatever mischief was afoot in those last Dutch days of New Amsterdam  on the island of Manhattan .  But this time he was conjuring a more serious bit of mischief than  even he usually attempted . This was plain from the appearance of the  startled but deeply interested faces of the half - dozen boys gathered  around him on the bridge .  "" But I say , Patem , "" queried young Teuny Vanderbreets , who was always  ready to second any of Patem 's plans , "" how can we come it over the  dominie as you would have us ? ""  "" So then , Teuny , "" cried Patem , in his highest key of contempt , "" did  your wits blow away with your hat out of Heer Snediker 's nut tree  yesterday ? Do not you know that the Heer Governor is at royal odds with  Dominie Curtius because the skinflint old dominie will not pay the  taxes"	1	0
"That 's  what I did hear them say at the Stadt Huys this morning , and Heer  Vanderveer , the schepen , said there , too , that Dominie Curtius was not  worth one of the five hundred guilders which he doth receive for our  teaching . And sure , if the burgomaster and schepens will have none of  the old dominie , why then no more will we who know how stupid are his  lessons , and how his switch doth sting . So , hoy , lads , let 's turn him  out . ""  And with that little Patem Onderdonk gave Teuny Vanderbreets ' broad  back a sounding slap with his battered horn book and crying , "" Come on ,  lads , "" headed his mutinous companions on a race for the rickety little  schoolhouse near the fort .  It was hard lines for Dominie Curtius all that day at school . The boys  had never been so unruly ; the girls never so inattentive . Rebellion  seemed in the air , and the dominie , never a patient or gentle - mannered  man , grew harsher and more exacting as the session advanced . His  reign as master of the Latin School of New Amsterdam had not been  a successful one , and his dispute with the town officers as to his  payment of taxes had so angered him that , as Patem declared , "" he seemed  moved to avenge himself upon the town 's children . ""  This being the state of affairs , Dominie Curtius 's mood this day was  not a pleasant one , and the school exercises had more to do with the  whipping horse and the birch twigs than with the horn book and the  Latin conjugations .  The boys , I regret to say , were hardened to this , because of much  practice , but when the dominie , enraged at some fresh breach of rigid  discipline , glared savagely over his big spectacles and then swooped  down upon pretty little Antje Adrianse who had done nothing whatever ,  the whole school broke into open rebellion . Horn books , and every  possible missile that the boys had at hand , went flying at the master 's  head , and the young rebels , led on by Patem and Teuny , charged down  upon the unprepared dominie , rescued trembling little Antje from his  clutch , and then one and all rushed pell - mell from the school with  shouts of triumph and derision .  But when the first flush of their victory was over , the boys realized  that they had done a very daring and risky thing . It was no small  matter in those days of stern authority"	1	0
"  Patem waved his hand like a young Napoleon .   _ Ach ! _ ye are all cowards , "" he cried shrilly . "" What will we _ do _ ? Why ,  then we will but do as if we were burgomasters and schepens -- as we will  be some day . We will to the Heer Governor straight , and lay our demands  before him . ""  Well , well ; this _ was _ bold talk ! The Heer Governor ! Not a boy in all  New Amsterdam but would sooner face a gray wolf in the Sapokanican  woods than the Heer Governor Stuyvesant .  "" So then , Patem Onderdonk , "" they cried , "" you may do it yourself , for ,  good faith , we will not . ""  "" Why , "" said Jan Hooglant , "" why , Patem , the Heer Governor will have us  rated soundly over the ears for daring such a thing ; and we will all  catch more of it when we get home . Demand of the Heer Governor indeed !  Why , boy , you must be crazy ! ""  But Patem was not crazy . He was simply determined ; and at last , by  threats and arguments and coaxing words , he gradually won over a  half - dozen of the boldest spirits to his side and , without more ado ,  started with them to interview the Heer Governor .  But , quickly as they acted , the schoolmaster was still more prompt in  action . Defeated and deserted by his scholars , Dominie Curtius had  raged about the schoolroom for a while , spluttering angrily in mingled  Dutch and Polish , and then , clapping his broad black hat upon his head ,  marched straight to the fort to lay his grievance before the Heer  Governor .  The Heer Petrus Stuyvesant , Director General for the Dutch West India  Company in their colony of New Netherlands , walked up and down the  Governor 's chamber in the fort at New Amsterdam wofully perplexed . The  Heer Governor was not a patient man , and a combination of annoyances  was hedging him about and making his government of his island province  anything but pleasant work .  The "" malignant English "" of the Massachusetts and Hartford colonies were  pressing their claim to the ownership of the New Netherlands , just as ,  to the south , the settlers on Lord De La Ware 's patent were also doing ;  the "" people called Quakers , "" whom the Heer Governor had publicly  whipped for heresy and sent a - packing , were spreading their "" pernicious  doctrine "" through Long Island and other"	1	0
"For the  Heer Governor could not bear to have things go wrong .  Suddenly , with scant ceremony and but the apology of a request for  admittance , there came into the Heer Governor 's presence the Dominie  Doctor Alexander Carolus Curtius , master of the Latin School .  "" Here is a pretty pass , Heer Governor ! "" he cried excitedly . "" My pupils  of the Latin School have turned upon me in revolt and have deserted me  in a body . ""  "" _ Ach _ ; then you are rightly served for a craven and a miser , sir ! ""  burst out the angry Governor , turning savagely upon the surprised  schoolmaster .  This was a most unexpected reception for Doctor and Dominie Curtius .  But , as it happened , the Heer Governor Stuyvesant was just now  particularly vexed with the objectionable Dominie . At much trouble and  after much solicitation on his part the Heer Governor had prevailed  upon his superiors and the proprietors of the province , the Dutch West  India Company , to send from Holland a schoolmaster or "" rector "" for the  children of their town of New Amsterdam , and the Company had sent over  Dominie Curtius .  The Heer Governor had entertained great hopes of what the new  schoolmaster was to do , and now to find him a subject of complaint from  both the parents of the scholars and the officials of the town made the  hasty Governor doubly dissatisfied . The Dominie 's intrusion , therefore ,  at just this stage of all his perplexities gave the Heer Governor a  most convenient person on whom to vent his bad feelings .  "" Yes , sirrah , a craven and a miser ! "" continued the angry Governor ,  stamping upon the floor with both wooden leg and massive cane . "" You ,  who can neither govern our children nor pay your just dues to the town ,  can be no fit master for our youth . No words , sirrah , no words , "" he  added , as the poor dominie tried to put in a word in his defence , "" no  words , sir ; you are discharged from further labour in this province . I  will see that one who can rule wisely and pay his just dues shall be  placed here in your stead . ""  Protests and appeals , explanations and arguments , were of no avail .  When the Heer Governor Stuyvesant said a thing , he meant it , and it was  useless for any one to hope for a change . The unpopular Dominie Curtius  must go -- and go he did .  But , as he"	1	0
" "" So , so , young rapscallions , "" he cried , "" you , too , must needs disturb  the peace and push yourself forward into public quarrels ! Get you gone !  I will have none of your words . Is it not enough that I must needs send  the schoolmaster a - packing , without being worried by graceless young  varlets as you ? ""  "" And hath the Dominie Curtius gone indeed , Heer Governor ? "" Patem dared  to ask .  "" Hath he , hath he , boy ? "" echoed the Governor , turning upon his  audacious young questioner with uplifted cane . "" Said I not so , and will  you dare doubt my word , rascal ? Begone from the fort , all of you , ere I  do put you all in limbo , or send word to your good folk to give you the  floggings you do no doubt all so richly deserve . ""  Discretion is the better part of valour , and the boyish delegation  hastily withdrew . But when once they were safely out of hearing of the  Heer Governor , beyond the Land Gate at the Broad Way , they took breath  and indulged in a succession of boyish shouts .  "" And that doth mean no school , too ! "" cried young Patem Onderdonk ,  flinging his cap in air . "" Huzzoy for that , lads ; huzzoy for that ! ""  And the "" huzzoys "" came with right good - will from every boy of the group .  Within less than a week the whole complexion of affairs in that  little island city was entirely changed . Both the Massachusetts and  the Maryland claimants ceased , for a time at least , their unfounded  demands . A treaty at Hartford settled the disputed question of  boundary - lines , and the Maryland governor declared "" that he had not  intended to meddle with the government of Manhattan . "" Added to this ,  Sewackenamo , chief of the Esopus Indians , came to the fort at New  Amsterdam and "" gave the right hand of friendship "" to the Heer Governor ,  and by the interchange of presents a treaty of peace was ratified . So ,  one by one , the troubles of the Heer Governor melted away , his brow  became clear and , "" partaking of the universal satisfaction , "" so says  the historian , "" he proclaimed a day of general thanksgiving . ""  Thanksgiving in the colonies was a matter of almost yearly occurrence .  Since the first Thanksgiving Day on American shores , when , in 1621 ,  the Massachusetts colony , at the request of Governor Bradford ,"	1	0
"And the Dutch colonists in  America followed the customs of the Fatherland quite as piously and  fervently as did the English colonists .  So , when the proclamation of the Heer Governor Stuyvesant for a day of  thanksgiving was made known , in this year of mercies , 1659 , all the  townfolk of New Amsterdam made ready to keep it .  But young people are often apt to think that the world moves for  them alone . The boys of this little Dutch town at the mouth of the  Hudson were no different from other boys , and cared less for treaties  and Indians and boundary questions than for their own matters .  They , therefore , concluded that the Heer Governor had proclaimed a  thanksgiving because , as young Patem Onderdonk declared , "" he had gotten  well rid of Dominie Curtius and would have no more schoolmasters in the  colony . ""  "" And so , lads , "" cried the exuberant young Knickerbocker , "" let us wisely  celebrate the Thanksgiving . I will even ask the mother to make for me a  rare salmagundi which we lads , who were so rated by the Heer Governor ,  will ourselves give to him as our Thanksgiving offering , for the Heer  Governor , so folk do say , doth rarely like the salmagundi . ""  Now the salmagundi was ( to some palates ) a most appetizing mixture ,  compounded of salted mackerel , or sometimes of chopped meat , seasoned  with oil and vinegar , pepper and raw onions -- not an altogether  attractive dish to read of , but welcome to and dearly loved by many  an old Knickerbocker even up to a recent date . Its name , too , as most  of you bright boys and girls doubtless know , furnished the title  for one of the works of Washington Irving , best loved of all the  Knickerbockers .  Thanksgiving Day came around , and so did Patem 's salmagundi , as highly  seasoned and appetizing a one as the Goode Vrouw Onderdonk could make .  The lengthy prayers and lengthier sermon of good Dominie Megapolensis  in the Fort Church were over and the Thanksgiving dinners were very  nearly ready when up to the Heer Governor 's house came a half - dozen  boys , with Patem Onderdonk at their head bearing a neatly covered dish .  Patem had well considered and formed in his mind what he deemed just  the speech of presentation to please the Heer Governor , but when the  time came to face that awful personage his valour and his eloquence  alike began to ooze away .  And , it must be confessed , the Heer Governor Stuyvesant did not "	1	0
" And as for the boys themselves , when once they stood in the presence of  the greatest dignitary in the province , Patem 's ready tongue seemed to  cleave to the roof of his mouth , and he hummed and hawed and hesitated  until the worthy Heer Governor lost patience and broke in :  "" Well , well , boys ; what is the stir ? Speak quick if at all , for when a  man 's dinner waiteth he hath scant time for stammering boys . ""  Then Patem spoke up .  "" Heer Governor , "" he said , "" the boys hereabout , remembering your  goodness in sending away our most pestilential master , the Dominie  Curtius , and in proclaiming a Thanksgiving for his departure and for  the ending of our schooling---- ""  "" What , what , boy ! "" cried the Heer Governor , "" art crazy then , or would  you seek to make sport of me , your governor ? Thanksgiving for the  breaking up of school ! Out on you for a set of malapert young knaves !  Do you think the world goeth but for your pleasures alone ? Why , this  is ribald talk ! I made no Thanksgiving for your convenience , rascals ,  but because that the Lord in His grace hath relieved the town from  danger---- ""  "" Of which , Heer Governor , "" broke in the most impolitic Patem , "" we did  think the Dominie Curtius and his school were part . And so we have  brought to you this salmagundi as our Thanksgiving offering to you for  thus freeing us of a pest and a sorrow---- ""  "" How now , how now , sirrah ! "" again came the interruption from the  scandalized Heer Governor when he could recover from his surprise , "" do  you then dare to call your schooling a pest and a sorrow ? Why , you  graceless young varlets , I do not seek to free you from schooling . I do  even now seek to bring you speedily the teaching you do so much stand  in need of . Even now , within the week forthcoming , the good Dominie  Luyck , the tutor of mine own household , will see to the training and  teaching of this town , and so I will warrant to the flogging , too , of  all you sad young rapscallions who even now by this your wicked talk do  show your need both of teaching and of flogging . ""  And then , forgetful of the boys ' Thanksgiving offering and in high  displeasure at what he deemed their wilful and deliberate ignorance ,  the Heer Governor turned the delegation into the street"	1	0
" Here is a fine mix - up -- a regular salmagundi , Patem  Onderdonk , and no question . And you did say that this Thanksgiving  was all our work . Out upon you , say I ! Here are we to be saddled with  a worse master than before . Hermanus Smeeman did tell me that Nick  Stuyvesant did tell him that Dominie Luyck is a most hard and worryful  master .   There was a universal groan of disappointment and disgust , and then  Patem said philosophically :  "" Well , lads , what 's done is done and what is to be will be . Let us eat  the salmagundi anyhow and cry , ' Confusion to Dominie Luyck . ' ""  And they did eat it , then and there , for indigestion had no terror to  those lads of hardy stomachs .  But as for the toast of "" Confusion to Dominie Luyck , "" that came  to naught . For Dominie Aegidius Luyck proved a most efficient and  skilful teacher . Under his rule the Latin School of New Amsterdam  became famous throughout the colonies , so that scholars came to it  for instruction from Beaverwyck and South River and even from distant  Virginia .  So the Thanksgiving of the boys of New Amsterdam became a day of  mourning , and Patem 's influence as a leader and an oracle suffered  sadly for a while .  Five years after , on a sad Monday morning in September , 1664 , the  little city was lost to the Dutch West India Company and , spite of  the efforts and protests of its sturdy Governor , the red , white , and  blue banner of the Netherlands gave place to the flag of England .  And when that day came the young fellows who then saw the defeat and  disappointment of the Heer Governor Stuyvesant were not so certain  that Patem Onderdonk was wrong when he claimed that it was all a just  and righteous judgment on the Heer Governor for his refusal of the  boys ' request for no school , and for his treatment of them on that sad  Thanksgiving Day when he so harshly rebuked their display of gratitude  and lost forever his chance to partake of Patem 's Salmagundi .  MRS . NOVEMBER 'S DINNER PARTY      An amusing allegorical fantasy . All the most      interesting Days , grandchildren of Mother Year , came to      Mrs. November 's dinner party , to honour the birthday of      her daughter , Thanksgiving .  THE widow November was very busy indeed this year . What with elections  and harvest homes , her hands were full to overflowing ; for she takes  great interest in politics ,"	1	0
" Then what a busy time ensued ! What a slaughter of unhappy barnyard  families -- turkeys , ducks , and chickens ! What a chopping of apples  and boiling of doughnuts ! What a picking of raisins and rolling of  pie crust , until every nook and corner of the immense storeroom was  stocked with "" savoury mince and toothsome pumpkin pies , "" while so great  was the confusion that even the stolid red - hued servant , Indian Summer ,  lost his head , and smoked so continually he always appeared surrounded  by a blue mist , as he piled logs upon the great bonfires in the yard ,  until they lighted up the whole country for miles around .  But at length all was ready ; the happy day had come , and all the little  Novembers , in their best "" bib and tucker , "" were seated in a row ,  awaiting the arrival of their uncles , aunts , and cousins , while their  mother , in russet - brown silk trimmed with misty lace , looked them over ,  straightening Guy Fawkes 's collar , tying Thanksgiving 's neck ribbon ,  and settling a dispute between two little presidential candidates as to  which should sit at the head of the table .  Soon a merry clashing of bells , blowing of horns , and mingling of  voices were heard outside , sleighs and carriages dashed up to the door ,  and in came , "" just in season , "" Grandpa Time , with Grandma Year leaning  on his arm , followed by all their children and grandchildren , and were  warmly welcomed by the hostess and her family .  "" Oh , how glad I am we could all come to - day ! "" said Mr. January , in his  crisp , clear tones , throwing off his great fur coat , and rushing to the  blazing fire . "" There is nothing like the happy returns of these days . ""  "" Nothing , indeed , "" simpered Mrs. February , the poetess . "" If I had had  time I should have composed some verses for the occasion ; but my son  Valentine has brought a sugar heart , with a sweet sentiment on it , to  his cousin Thanksgiving . I , too , have taken the liberty of bringing a  sort of adopted child of mine , young Leap Year , who makes us a visit  every four years . ""  "" He is very welcome , I am sure , "" said Mrs. November , patting Leap Year  kindly on the head . "" And , Sister March , how have you been since we last  met ? ""  "" Oh !"	1	0
"   He ! he ! he ! "" tittered little April Fool . "" What a sell ! "" And he shook  until the bells on his cap rang ; at which his father ceased for a  moment showering kisses on his nieces and nephews , and boxed his ears  for his rudeness .  "" Oh , Aunt May ! do tell us a story , "" clamoured the younger children , and  dragging her into a corner she was soon deep in such a moving tale that  they were all melted to tears , especially the little Aprils , who cry  very easily .  Meanwhile , Mrs. June , assisted by her youngest daughter , a "" sweet girl  graduate , "" just from school , was engaged in decking the apartment with  roses and lilies and other fragrant flowers that she had brought from  her extensive gardens and conservatories , until the room was a perfect  bower of sweetness and beauty ; while Mr. July draped the walls with  flags and banners , lighted the candles , and showed off the tricks of  his pet eagle , Yankee Doodle , to the great delight of the little ones .  Madam August , who suffers a great deal with the heat , found a seat on  a comfortable sofa , as far from the fire as possible , and waved a huge  feather fan back and forth , while her thirty - one boys and girls , led by  the two oldest , Holiday and Vacation , ran riot through the long rooms ,  picking at their Aunt June 's flowers , and playing all sorts of pranks ,  regardless of tumbled hair and torn clothes , while they shouted ,  "" Hurrah for fun ! "" and behaved like a pack of wild colts let loose in a  green pasture , until their Uncle September called them , together with  his own children , into the library , and persuaded them to read some of  the books with which the shelves were filled , or play quietly with the  game of Authors and the Dissected Maps .  "" For , "" said Mr. September to Mrs. October , "" I think Sister August  lets her children romp too much . I always like improving games for  mine , although I have great trouble to make Equinox toe the line as he  should . ""  "" That is because you are a schoolmaster , "" laughed Mrs. October , shaking  her head , adorned with a wreath of gayly tinted leaves ; "" but where is  my baby ? ""  At that moment a cry was heard without , and Indian Summer came running  in to say that little All Hallows had fallen"	1	0
"He came with his pockets stuffed full  of toys and sugarplums , which he drew out from time to time , and gave  to his best - loved child , Merry Christmas , to distribute amongst the  children , who gathered eagerly around their little cousin , saying :      "" Christmas comes but once a year ,       But when she comes she brings good cheer . ""  At which Merry laughed gayly , and tossed her golden curls , in which  were twined sprays of holly and clusters of brilliant scarlet berries .  At last the great folding - doors were thrown open . Indian Summer  announced that dinner was served , and a long procession of old and  young being quickly formed , led by Mrs. November and her daughter  Thanksgiving , whose birthday it was , they filed into the spacious  dining - room , where stood the long table groaning beneath its weight of  good things , while four servants ran continually in and out bringing  more substantials and delicacies to grace the board and please the  appetite . Winter staggered beneath great trenchers of meat and  poultry , pies and puddings ; Spring brought the earliest and freshest  vegetables ; Summer , the richest creams and ices ; while Autumn served  the guests with fruit , and poured the sparkling wine .  All were gay and jolly , and many a joke was cracked as the contents of  each plate and dish melted away like snow before the sun ; and the great  fires roared in the wide chimneys as though singing a glad Thanksgiving  song .  New Year drank everybody 's health , and wished them "" many happy returns  of the day , "" while Twelfth Night ate so much cake he made himself quite  ill , and had to be put to bed .  Valentine sent mottoes to all the little girls , and praised their  bright eyes and glossy curls . "" For , "" said his mother , "" he is a sad  flatterer , and not nearly so truthful , I am sorry to say , as his  brother , George Washington , who never told a lie . ""  At which Grandfather Time gave George a quarter , and said he should  always remember what a good boy he was .  After dinner the fun increased , all trying to do something for the  general amusement . Mrs. March persuaded her son , St. Patrick , to dance  an Irish Jig , which he did to the tune of the "" Wearing of the Green , ""  which his brothers , Windy and Gusty , blew and whistled on their fingers .  Easter sang a beautiful song , the little Mays "" tripped"	1	0
" Mr. September tried to read an instructive story aloud , but was  interrupted by Equinox , April Fool , and little All Hallows , who pinned  streamers to his coat tails , covered him with flour , and would not let  him get through a line ; at which Mrs. October hugged her tricksy baby ,  and laughed until she cried , and Mr. September retired in disgust .  "" That is almost too bad , "" said Mrs. November , as she shook the popper  vigorously in which the corn was popping and snapping merrily ; "" but ,  Thanksgiving , you must not forget to thank your cousins for all they  have done to honour your birthday . ""  At which the demure little maiden went round to each one , and returned  her thanks in such a charming way it was quite captivating .  Grandmother Year at last began to nod over her teacup in the chimney  corner .  "" It is growing late , "" said Grandpa Time .  "" But we must have a Virginia Reel before we go , "" said Mr. December .  "" Oh , yes , yes ! "" cried all the children .  Merry Christmas played a lively air on the piano , and old and young  took their positions on the polished floor with grandpa and grandma at  the head .  Midsummer danced with Happy New Year , June 's Commencement with August 's  Holiday , Leap Year with May Day , and all "" went merry as a marriage  bell . ""  The fun was at its height when suddenly the clock in the corner struck  twelve . Grandma Year motioned all to stop , and Grandfather Time , bowing  his head , said softly , "" Hark ! my children , Thanksgiving Day is ended . ""  THE VISIT  A STORY OF THE CHILDREN OF THE TOWER      The children went back to spend Thanksgiving at      grandfather 's farm . They got into some trouble and were      afraid that they would miss their dinner .  EARLY one morning Grandmother Grey got up , opened the windows and doors  of the farmhouse , and soon everybody on the place was stirring . The  cook hurried breakfast , and no sooner was it over than Grandfather Grey  went out to the barn and hitched the two horses to the wagon .  "" Get up , Robin and Dobbin ! "" he said , as he drove through the big gate .  "" If you knew who were coming back in this wagon you would not be  stepping so slowly . ""  The old horses pricked up their ears when they heard this , and trotted  away as fast as they could"	1	0
" "" All off ! "" cried the conductor , as the train stopped ; and out came  a group of children who were , every one of them , Grandfather and  Grandmother Grey 's grandchildren . They had come to spend Thanksgiving  Day on the farm .  There was John , who was named for grandfather and looked just like him ,  and the twins , Teddie and Pat , who looked like nobody but each other ;  their papa was grandfather 's oldest son . Then there was Louisa , who  had a baby sister at home , and then Mary Virginia Martin , who was her  mamma 's only child .  "" I tell you , "" said grandfather , as he helped them into the wagon , "" your  grandmother will be glad to see you ! ""  And so she was . She was watching at the window for them when they  drove up , and when the children spied her they could scarcely wait for  grandfather to stop the wagon before they scrambled out .  "" Dear me , dear me ! "" said grandmother , as they all tried to kiss her at  the same time , "" how you have grown . ""  "" I am in the first grade , "" said John , hugging her with all his might .  "" So am I , "" cried Louisa .  "" We are going to be , "" chimed in the twins ; and then they all talked at  once , till grandmother could not hear herself speak .  Then , after they had told her all about their mammas and papas , and  homes , and cats and dogs , they wanted to go and say "" how do you do "" to  everything on the place .  "" Take care of yourselves , "" called grandmother , "" for I do n't want to  send any broken bones home to your mothers . ""  "" I can take care of myself , "" said John .  "" So can we , "" said the rest ; and off they ran .  First they went to the kitchen where Mammy ' Ria was getting ready to  cook the Thanksgiving dinner ; then out to the barnyard , where there  were two new red calves , and five little puppies belonging to Juno , the  dog , for them to see . Then they climbed the barnyard fence and made  haste to the pasture where grandfather kept his woolly sheep . "" Baa - a ! ""  said the sheep when they saw the children ; but then , they always said  that , no matter what happened .  There were cows in this pasture , too"	1	0
" "" Do n't cry , "" said Louisa . "" Let 's go to the hickory - nut tree . ""  This pleased them all , and they hurried off ; but on the way they  came to the big shed where grandfather kept his plows and reaper and  threshing machine and all his garden tools .  The shed had a long , wide roof , and there was a ladder leaning against  it . When John saw that , he thought he must go up on the roof ; and then ,  of course , the twins went , too . Then Louisa and Mary Virginia wanted to  go , and although John insisted that girls could not climb , they managed  to scramble up the ladder to where the boys were . And there they all  sat in a row on the roof .  "" Grandmother does n't know how well we can take care of ourselves , "" said  John . "" But I am such a big boy that I can do anything . I can ride a  bicycle and go on errands---- ""  "" So can I , "" said Louisa .  "" We can ride on the trolley ! "" cried the twins .  "" Mamma and I go anywhere by ourselves , "" said Mary Virginia .  "" Moo ! "" said something down below ; and when they looked , there was one  of the cows rubbing her head against the ladder .  "" Do n't be afraid , Mary Virginia , "" said Louisa . "" Cows ca n't climb  ladders . ""  "" Do n't be afraid , Mary Virginia , "" said John . "" I 'll drive her away . ""  So he kicked his feet against the shed roof and called , "" Go away !  go away ! "" The twins kicked their feet , too , and called , "" Go away !  go away ! "" and somebody , I do n't know who , kicked the ladder and it  fell down and lay in the dry grass . And the cow walked peacefully on ,  thinking about her little calf .  "" There , now ! "" exclaimed Louisa , "" how shall we ever get down ? ""  "" Oh , that 's nothing , "" said John . "" All I 'll have to do is to stand up on  the roof and call grandfather . Just watch me do it . ""  So he stood up and called , "" Grandfather ! Grandfather ! Grandfather ! ""  till he was tired ; but no grandfather answered .  Then the twins called , "" Grandfather ! Grandmother ! ""  "" Baa , "" said the sheep , as"	1	0
" "" I want to go home to my mother ! I wish I had n't come ! "" wailed Mary  Virginia .  "" It 's Thanksgiving dinner time , too , "" said John , "" and there 's turkey  for dinner , for I saw it in the oven . ""  "" Pie , too , "" said Louisa .  "" Dear , dear ! "" cried the twins .  And then they all called together once more , but this time with such a  weak little cry that not even the sheep heard it .  The sun grew warmer and the shadows straighter as they sat there , and  grandmother 's house seemed miles away when John stood up to look at it .  "" They 've eaten dinner by this time , I know , "" he said as he sat down  again ; "" and grandfather and grandmother have forgotten all about us . ""  But grandfather and grandmother had not forgotten them , for just about  then grandmother was saying to grandfather : "" You had better see where  the children are , for Thanksgiving dinner will soon be ready and I know  that they are hungry . ""  So grandfather went out to look for them . He did not find them in the  kitchen nor the barnyard , so he called , "" Johnnie ! Johnnie ! "" and when  nobody answered he made haste to the pasture .  The children saw him coming , and long before he had reached the  gate they began to call with all their might . This time grandfather  answered , "" I 'm coming ! "" and I can not tell you how glad they were .  In another minute he had set the ladder up again and they all came  down . Mary Virginia came first because she was the youngest girl , and  John came last because he was the biggest boy . Grandfather put his arms  around each one as he helped them down , and carried Mary Virginia home  on his back . When they got to the house dinner was just ready .      The turkey was brown , the potatoes were sweet ,      The sauce was so spicy , the biscuits were beat ,      The great pumpkin pie was as yellow as gold ,      And the apples were red as the roses , I 'm told .  It was such a good dinner that I had to tell you about it in rhyme !      And I 'm sure you 'll agree ,      With the children and me ,      That there 's never a visit so pleasant to pay      As a visit to grandma on Thanksgiving Day .  THE STORY OF RUTH AND NAOMI "	1	0
" NOW it came to pass , many hundreds of years ago , that there was a good  woman named Naomi who lived in the land of the Moabites . She had once  been very rich and happy , but now her husband was dead and her two sons  also , and she had left only Orpah and Ruth , the wives of her sons .  There was a famine in the land . Naomi could find no grain in the fields  to beat into flour . She and Orpah and Ruth were lonely and sad and very  hungry .  But Naomi heard there was a land where the Lord had visited His people  and given them bread ; so she went forth from the place where she was ,  and her two daughters with her , to the land called Judah . It was a  long , hard way to go . There were rough roads to travel and steep hills  to climb . Their feet grew so weary they could scarcely walk , and at  last Naomi said :  "" Go , return each to your father 's house . The Lord deal kindly with you  as you have dealt with me . The Lord grant you that you may find rest . ""  Then she kissed them , and Orpah kissed her and left her , but Ruth would  not leave Naomi . And Naomi said to Ruth :  "" Behold , thy sister is gone back unto her own people ; return thou ! ""  But Ruth clung to Naomi more closely , as she said :  "" Entreat me not to leave thee , or to return from following after thee :  for whither thou goest , there will I go ; and where thou lodgest , there  will I lodge . Thy people shall be my people , and thy God my God . ""  When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much , she forgot how tired and  hungry she was , and the two journeyed on together until they came to  Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest . There was  no famine in Bethlehem . The fields were full of waving grain , and busy  servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves .  Above all were the fields of the rich man , Boaz , shining with barley  and corn .  Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy  reapers . They saw that after each sheaf was bound , and each pile of  corn was stacked , a little grain fell , unnoticed , to the ground . Ruth  said to Naomi : "" Let me go to the field and glean the"	1	0
" And she went , and came  and gleaned in the field after the reapers .  And Boaz came from Bethlehem , and said to his reapers :  Whose damsel is  this ? "" for he saw how very beautiful Ruth was , and how busily she was  gleaning . The reapers said : "" It is the damsel that came back with Naomi  out of the land of the Moabites . ""  And Ruth ran up to Boaz , crying : "" I pray you , let me glean and gather  after the reapers among the sheaves . ""  And Boaz , who was good and kind , said to Ruth :  "" Hearest thou not , my daughter ? Go not to glean in any other field , but  abide here . ""  Then Ruth bowed herself to the ground , and said : "" Why have I found such  favour in thine eyes , seeing I am a stranger ? ""  And Boaz answered her : "" It hath been showed me all that thou hast done  to thy mother . ""  So , all day , Ruth gleaned in Boaz 's fields . At noon she ate bread and  parched corn with the others . Boaz commanded his reapers to let fall  large handfuls of grain , as they worked , for Ruth to gather , and at  night she took it all home to Naomi .  "" Where hast thou gleaned to - day ? "" asked Naomi , when she saw the food  that Ruth had brought to her .  "" The man 's name with whom I wrought to - day is Boaz , "" said Ruth . And  Naomi said : "" Blessed be he of the Lord -- the man is near of kin unto us . ""  So Ruth gleaned daily , and at the end of the barley harvest the good  man Boaz took Ruth and Naomi to live with him in his own house forever .  BERT 'S THANKSGIVING      Bert is a manly , generous , warm - hearted fellow . Other      boys will like to read how good luck began to come his      way on a certain memorable Thanksgiving Day .  AT NOON , on a dreary November day , a lonesome little fellow , looking  very red about the ears and very blue about the mouth , stood kicking  his heels at the door of a cheap eating house in Boston , and offering a  solitary copy of a morning paper for sale to the people passing .  But there were really not many people passing , for it was Thanksgiving  Day , and the shops were shut , and everybody who had a home to go to and  a"	1	0
" It was possible , however , that he was considering whether he could  afford himself the indulgence of a morning paper ( seeing it was  Thanksgiving Day ) ; so , at least , Bert thought , and accosted him  accordingly .  "" Buy a paper , sir ? All about the fire in East Boston , and arrest of  safe - burglars in Springfield . Only two cents ! ""  The little old man looked at the boy with keen gray eyes , which seemed  to light up the pinched and skinny face , and answered in a shrill voice  that whistled through white front teeth :  "" You ought to come down in your price this time of day . You ca n't  expect to sell a morning paper at twelve o'clock for full price . ""  "" Well , give me a cent then , "" said Bert . "" That 's less'n cost ; but never  mind ; I 'm bound to sell out anyhow . ""  "" You look cold , "" said the old man .  "" Cold ? "" replied Bert ; "" I 'm froze . And I want my dinner . And I 'm going  to have a big dinner , too , seeing it 's Thanksgiving Day . ""  "" Ah ! lucky for you , my boy ! "" said the old man . "" You 've a home to go to ,  and friends , too , I hope ? ""  "" No , _ sir _ ; nary home , and nary friend ; only my mother""--Bert  hesitated , and grew serious ; then suddenly changed his tone--""and  Hop Houghton . I told him to meet me here , and we 'd have a first - rate  Thanksgiving dinner together ; for it 's no fun to be eatin ' alone  Thanksgiving Day ! It sets a feller thinking of everything , if he ever  had a home and then hain't got a home any more . ""  "" It 's more lonesome not to eat at all , "" said the old man , his gray eyes  twinkling . "" And what can a boy like you have to think of ? Here , I guess  I can find one cent for you , though there 's nothing in the paper , I  know . ""  The old man spoke with some feeling , his fingers trembled , and somehow  he dropped two cents instead of one into Bert 's hand .  "" Here ! You 've made a mistake ! "" cried Bert . "" A bargain 's a bargain .  You 've given me a cent too much . ""  "" No , I did n't . I never give anybody"	1	0
" "" No matter , "" said the old man , "" it will be so much less for _ my _  dinner , that 's all . ""  Bert had instinctively pocketed the pennies when , on a moment 's  reflection , his sympathies were excited .  "" Poor old man ! "" he thought ; "" he 's seen better days I guess . Perhaps  he 's no home . A boy like me can stand it , but I guess it must be hard  for _ him _ . He _ meant _ to give me the odd cent all the while ; and I  do n't believe he has had a decent dinner for many a day . ""  All this , which I have been obliged to write out slowly in words , went  through Bert 's mind like a flash . He was a generous little fellow ,  and any kindness shown him , no matter how trifling , made his heart  overflow .  "" Look here ! "" he cried , "" where are _ you _ going to get your dinner  to - day ? ""  "" I can get a bite here as well as anywhere . It do n't matter much to  me , "" replied the old man .  "" Dine with _ me _ , "" said Bert , laughing . "" I 'd like to have you . ""  "" I 'm afraid I could n't afford to dine as you are going to , "" said the  man , with a smile , his eyes twinkling again and his white front teeth  shining .  "" I 'll pay for your dinner ! "" Bert exclaimed . "" Come ! We do n't have a  Thanksgiving but once a year , and a feller wants a good time then . ""  "" But you are waiting for another boy . ""  "" Oh , Hop Houghton ! He wo n't come now , it 's so late . He 's gone to a  place down in North Street , I guess -- a place I do n't like : there 's so  much tobacco smoked and so much beer drank there . "" Bert cast a final  glance up the street . "" No , he wo n't come now . So much the worse for  him ! He likes the men down there ; I do n't . ""  "" Ah ! "" said the man , taking off his hat , and giving it a brush with  his elbow , as they entered the restaurant , as if trying to appear as  respectable as he could in the eyes of a newsboy of such fastidious  tastes .  To make him feel quite comfortable"	1	0
"I ai n't the least mite  aristocratic . ""  "" Ah , indeed ! "" And the old man smiled again , and seemed to look  relieved . "" I 'm very glad to hear it . ""  He placed his hat on the floor and took a seat opposite Bert at a  little table , which they had all to themselves .  Bert offered him the bill of fare .  "" No , I must ask you to choose for me ; but nothing very extravagant , you  know . I 'm used to plain fare . ""  "" So am I. But I 'm going to have a good dinner for once in my life , and  so shall you ! "" cried Bert , generously . "" What do you say to chicken  soup , and then wind up with a thumping big piece of squash pie ? How 's  that for a Thanksgiving dinner ? ""  "" Sumptuous ! "" said the old man , appearing to glow with the warmth of  the room and the prospect of a good dinner . "" But wo n't it cost you too  much ? ""  "" Too much ? No , _ sir _ ! "" laughed Bert . "" Chicken soup , fifteen cents ;  pie -- they give tremendous pieces here ; thick , I tell you -- ten cents .  That 's twenty - five cents ; half a dollar for two . Of course , I do n't do  this way every day in the year . But mother 's glad to have me , once in a  while . Here , waiter ! "" And Bert gave his princely order as if it were no  very great thing for a liberal young fellow like him , after all .  "" Where is your mother ? Why do n't you dine with her ? "" the little man  asked .  Bert 's face grew sober in a moment .  "" That 's the question : why do n't I ? I 'll tell you why I do n't . I 've got  the best mother in the world . What I 'm trying to do is to make a home  for her , so we can live together and eat our Thanksgiving dinners  together some time . Some boys want one thing , some another . There 's one  goes in for good times ; another 's in such a hurry to get rich he do n't  care much how he does it ; but what I want most of anything is to be  with my mother and my two sisters again , and I ai n't ashamed to say so . ""  Bert 's eyes grew very tender , and he"	1	0
"When his business was settled up -- he kept a little grocery store  on Hanover Street -- it was found he had n't left us anything . We had  lived pretty well up to that time , and I and my two sisters had been  to school ; but then mother had to do something , and her friends got  her places to go out nursing , and she 's a nurse now . Everybody likes  her , and she has enough to do . We could n't be with her , of course . She  got us boarded at a good place , but I saw how hard it was going to be  for her to support us , so I said , ' I 'm a boy ; _ I _ can do something for  _ myself _ . You just pay their board , and keep 'em to school , and I 'll go  to work , and maybe help you a little , besides taking care of myself . ' ""  "" What could _ you _ do ? "" said the little old man .  "" That 's it . I was only ' leven years old , and what could I ? What I  should have liked would have been some nice place where I could do  light work , and stand a chance of learning a good business . But  beggars must n't be choosers . I could n't find such a place ; and I  was n't going to be loafing about the streets , so I went to selling  newspapers . I 've sold newspapers ever since , and I shall be twelve  years old next month . ""  "" You like it ? "" said the old man .  "" I like to get my own living , "" replied Bert , proudly , "" but what I want  is to learn some trade , or regular business , and settle down , and make  a home for---- But there 's no use talking about that . Make the best of  things , that 's my motto . Do n't this soup smell good ? And do n't it taste  good , too ? They have n't put so much chicken in yours as they have in  mine . If you do n't mind my having tasted it , we 'll change . ""  The old man declined this liberal offer , took Bert 's advice to help  himself freely to bread , which "" did n't cost anything , "" and ate his soup  with prodigious relish , as it seemed to Bert , who grew more and more  hospitable and patronizing as the repast proceeded .  "" Come , now , wo n't you have something between the soup"	1	0
" "" All right ! Here , waiter ! Two pieces of your fattest and biggest squash  pie ; and a cup of tea , strong , for this gentleman . ""  "" I 've told you about myself , "" added Bert ; "" suppose , now , _ you _ tell  _ me _ something . ""  "" About myself ? ""  "" Yes . I think that would go pretty well with the pie . ""  But the man shook his head . "" I could go back and tell about my plans  and hopes when I was a lad of your age , but it would be too much like  your own story over again . Life is n't what we think it will be when  we are young . You 'll find that out soon enough . I am all alone in the  world now , and I am sixty - seven years old . ""  "" Have some cheese with your pie , wo n't you ? It must be so lonely at  your age ! What do you do for a living ? ""  "" I have a little place in Devonshire Street . My name is Crooker . You 'll  find me up two flights of stairs , back room , at the right . Come and see  me , and I 'll tell you all about my business , and perhaps help you to  such a place as you want , for I know several business men . Now do n't  fail . ""  And Mr. Crooker wrote his address with a little stub of a pencil on a  corner of the newspaper which had led to their acquaintance , tore it  off carefully , and gave it to Bert .  Thereupon the latter took a card from his pocket , not a very clean one ,  I must say ( I am speaking of the card , though the remark will apply  equally well to the pocket ) and handed it across the table to his new  friend .  "" _ Herbert Hampton , Dealer in Newspapers _ , "" the old man read , with his  sharp gray eyes , which glanced up funnily at Bert , seeming to say ,  "" Is n't this rather aristocratic for a twelve - year - old newsboy ? ""  Bert blushed , and explained : "" Got up for me by a printer 's boy I know .  I 'd done some favours for him , so he made me a few cards . Handy to have  sometimes , you know . ""  "" Well , Herbert , "" said the little old man , "" I 'm glad to have made your  acquaintance . The pie was excellent"	1	0
"Now wo n't you let me pay for my  dinner ? I believe I have money enough . Let me see . ""  Bert would not hear of such a thing , but walked up to the desk and  settled the bill with the air of a person who did not regard a trifling  expense .  When he looked around again the little old man was gone .  "" Never mind , I 'll go and see him the first chance I have , "" said Bert ,  as he looked at the pencilled strip of newspaper margin again before  putting it into his pocket .  He then went round to his miserable quarters , in the top of a cheap  lodging - house , where he made himself ready , by means of soap and water  and a broken comb , to walk five miles into the suburbs and get a sight ,  if only for five minutes , of his mother .  On the following Monday Bert , having a leisure hour , went to call on  his new acquaintance in Devonshire Street .  Having climbed the two flights , he found the door of the back room at  the right ajar , and looking in , saw Mr. Crooker at a desk , in the act  of receiving a roll of money from a well - dressed visitor .  Bert entered unnoticed and waited till the money was counted and a  receipt signed . Then , as the visitor departed , old Mr. Crooker looked  round and saw Bert . He offered him a chair , then turned to lock up the  money in a safe .  "" So this is your place of business ? "" said Bert , glancing about the  plain office room . "" What do you do here ? ""  "" I buy real estate sometimes -- sell -- rent -- and so forth . ""  "" Who for ? "" asked Bert .  "" For myself , "" said little old Mr. Crooker , with a smile .  Bert stared , perfectly aghast at the situation . This , then , was the  man whom he had invited to dinner , and treated so patronizingly the  preceding Thursday !  "" I -- I thought -- you was a poor man . ""  "" I _ am _ a poor man , "" said Mr. Crooker , locking his safe . "" Money does n't  make a man rich . I 've money enough . I own houses in the city . They give  me something to think of , and so keep me alive . I had truer riches  once , but I lost them long ago . ""  From the way the old man 's"	1	0
" "" It _ was _ odd . "" And Mr. Crooker showed his white front teeth with a  smile . "" But it may turn out to have been a lucky circumstance for both  of us . I like you ; I believe in you ; and I 've an offer to make to you :  I want a trusty , bright boy in this office , somebody I can bring up  to my business , and leave it with , as I get too old to attend to it  myself . What do you say ? ""  What _ could _ Bert say ?  Again that afternoon he walked -- or rather , ran -- to his mother , and  after consulting with her , joyfully accepted Mr. Crooker 's offer .  Interviews between his mother and his employer soon followed , resulting  in something for which at first the boy had not dared to hope . The  lonely , childless old man , who owned so many houses , wanted a home ; and  one of these houses he offered to Mrs. Hampton , with ample support for  herself and her children , if she would also make it a home for him .  Of course this proposition was accepted ; and Bert soon had the  satisfaction of seeing the great ambition of his youth accomplished .  He had employment which promised to become a profitable business ( as  indeed it did in a few years , he and the old man proved so useful to  each other ) ; and , more than that , he was united once more with his  mother and sisters in a happy home where he has since had a good many  Thanksgiving dinners .  A THANKSGIVING STORY      A three - minute story for the littlest boys and girls .  IT WAS nearly time for Thanksgiving Day . The rosy apples and golden  pumpkins were ripe , and the farmers were bringing them into the markets .  One day when two little children , named John and Minnie , were going to  school , they saw the turkeys and chickens and pumpkins in the window of  a market , and they exclaimed , "" Oh , Thanksgiving Day ! Oh , Thanksgiving  Day ! "" After school was over , they ran home to their mother , and asked  her when Thanksgiving Day would be . She told them in about two weeks ;  then they began to talk about what they wanted for dinner , and asked  their mother a great many questions . She told them she hoped they  would have turkey and even the pumpkin pie they wanted so much , but  that Thanksgiving Day was not given us so that we might have a"	1	0
"And Thanksgiving Day was for  glad and happy thoughts about God , as well as for good things to eat .  Not long after , when John and Minnie were playing , John said to  Minnie , "" I wish I could do something to tell God how glad I am about  Thanksgiving . "" "" I wish so , too , "" said Minnie . Just then some little  birds came flying down to the ground , and Minnie said : "" Oh , I know . ""  Then she told John , but they agreed to keep it a secret till the day  came . Now what do you think they did ? Well , I will tell you .  They saved their pennies , and bought some corn , and early Thanksgiving  Day , before they had their dinner , they went out into the street near  their home , and scattered corn in a great many places . What for ? Why ,  for the birds . While they were doing it , John said , "" I know , Minnie ,  why you thought of the birds : because they do not have any papas and  mammas after they are grown up to get a dinner for them on Thanksgiving  Day . "" "" Yes , that is why , "" said Minnie .  By and by the birds came and found such a feast , and perhaps they knew  something about Thanksgiving Day and must have sung and chirped happily  all day .  JOHN INGLEFIELD 'S THANKSGIVING      A sad Thanksgiving story is a rarity indeed . But      the one which follows reminds us that the Puritans ,      although they originated our Thanksgiving festival ,      were after all a sombre people , seldom free from a      realizing sense of the imminence of sin . Nathaniel      Hawthorne , a genuine product of Puritanism , inherited      a full share of his forefathers ' constitutional      melancholy and preoccupation with the darker aspects of      life -- as this story bears witness .  ON THE evening of Thanksgiving Day , John Inglefield , the blacksmith ,  sat in his elbow - chair among those who had been keeping festival at  his board . Being the central figure of the domestic circle , the fire  threw its strongest light on his massive and sturdy frame , reddening  his rough visage so that it looked like the head of an iron statue , all  aglow , from his own forge , and with its features rudely fashioned on  his own anvil . At John Inglefield 's right hand was an empty chair . The  other places round the hearth were filled by the members of the family ,  who all sat quietly , while , with"	1	0
"There was also a daughter of sixteen , whom  nobody could look at without thinking of a rosebud almost blossomed .  The only other person at the fireside was Robert Moore , formerly an  apprentice of the blacksmith , but now his journeyman , and who seemed  more like an own son of John Inglefield than did the pale and slender  student .  Only these four had kept New England 's festival beneath that roof .  The vacant chair at John Inglefield 's right hand was in memory of his  wife , whom death had snatched from him since the previous Thanksgiving .  With a feeling that few would have looked for in his rough nature ,  the bereaved husband had himself set the chair in its place next his  own ; and often did his eye glance hitherward , as if he deemed it  possible that the cold grave might send back its tenant to the cheerful  fireside , at least for that one evening . Thus did he cherish the grief  that was clear to him . But there was another grief which he would fain  have torn from his heart ; or , since that could never be , have buried it  too deep for others to behold , or for his own remembrance . Within the  past year another member of his household had gone from him , but not to  the grave . Yet they kept no vacant chair for her .  While John Inglefield and his family were sitting round the hearth  with the shadows dancing behind them on the wall , the outer door was  opened , and a light footstep came along the passage . The latch of the  inner door was lifted by some familiar hand , and a young girl came in ,  wearing a cloak and hood , which she took off and laid on the table  beneath the looking - glass . Then , after gazing a moment at the fireside  circle , she approached , and took the seat at John Inglefield 's right  hand , as if it had been reserved on purpose for her .  "" Here I am , at last , father , "" said she . "" You ate your Thanksgiving  dinner without me , but I have come back to spend the evening with you . ""  Yes , it was Prudence Inglefield . She wore the same neat and maidenly  attire which she had been accustomed to put on when the household work  was over for the day , and her hair was parted from her brow in the  simple and modest fashion that became her best of all . If her cheek  might otherwise have been pale , yet the glow of the fire suffused it"	1	0
"She could not have looked less altered had she merely  stepped away from her father 's fireside for half an hour , and returned  while the blaze was quivering upward from the same brands that were  burning at her departure . And to John Inglefield she was the very image  of his buried wife , such as he remembered on the first Thanksgiving  which they had passed under their own roof . Therefore , though naturally  a stern and rugged man , he could not speak unkindly to his sinful  child , nor yet could he take her to his bosom .  "" You are welcome home , Prudence , "" said he , glancing sideways at her ,  and his voice faltered . "" Your mother would have rejoiced to see you ,  but she has been gone from us these four months . ""  "" I know , father , I know it , "" replied Prudence quickly . "" And yet , when I  first came in , my eyes were so dazzled by the firelight that she seemed  to be sitting in this very chair ! ""  By this time , the other members of the family had begun to recover  from their surprise , and became sensible that it was no ghost from the  grave , nor vision of their vivid recollections , but Prudence , her own  self . Her brother was the next that greeted her . He advanced and held  out his hand affectionately , as a brother should ; yet not entirely like  a brother , for , with all his kindness , he was still a clergyman and  speaking to a child of sin .  "" Sister Prudence , "" said he , earnestly , "" I rejoice that a merciful  Providence hath turned your steps homeward in time for me to bid you a  last farewell . In a few weeks , sister , I am to sail as a missionary to  the far islands of the Pacific . There is not one of these beloved faces  that I shall ever hope to behold again on this earth . Oh , may I see all  of them -- yours and all -- beyond the grave ! ""  A shadow flitted across the girl 's countenance .  "" The grave is very dark , brother , "" answered she , withdrawing her hand  somewhat hastily from his grasp . "" You must look your last at me by the  light of this fire . ""  While this was passing , the twin girl -- the rosebud that had grown on  the same stem with the castaway -- stood gazing at her sister , longing  to fling herself upon her bosom , so that the tendrils of their"	1	0
"But , as she listened to the familiar voice , while  the face grew more and more familiar , she forgot everything save that  Prudence had come back . Springing forward she would have clasped her in  a close embrace . At that very instant , however , Prudence started from  her chair and held out both her hands with a warning gesture .  "" No , Mary , no , my sister , "" cried she , "" do not you touch me ! Your bosom  must not be pressed to mine ! ""  Mary shuddered and stood still , for she felt that something darker  than the grave was between Prudence and herself , though they seemed so  near each other in the light of their father 's hearth , where they had  grown up together . Meanwhile Prudence threw her eyes around the room in  search of one who had not yet bidden her welcome . He had withdrawn from  his seat by the fireside and was standing near the door , with his face  averted so that his features could be discerned only by the flickering  shadow of the profile upon the wall . But Prudence called to him in a  cheerful and kindly tone :  "" Come , Robert , "" said she , "" wo n't you shake hands with your old friend ? ""  Robert Moore held back for a moment , but affection struggled  powerfully and overcame his pride and resentment ; he rushed toward  Prudence , seized her hand , and pressed it to his bosom .  "" There , there , Robert , "" said she , smiling sadly , as she withdrew her  hand , "" you must not give me too warm a welcome . ""  And now , having exchanged greetings with each member of the family ,  Prudence again seated herself in the chair at John Inglefield 's right  hand . She was naturally a girl of quick and tender sensibilities ,  gladsome in her general mood , but with a bewitching pathos interfused  among her merriest words and deeds . It was remarked of her , too , that  she had a faculty , even from childhood , of throwing her own feelings  like a spell over her companions . Such as she had been in her days of  innocence , so did she appear this evening . Her friends , in the surprise  and bewilderment of her return , almost forgot that she had ever left  them , or that she had forfeited any of her claims to their affection .  In the morning , perhaps , they might have looked at her with altered  eyes , but by the Thanksgiving fireside they felt only that their own  Prudence had"	1	0
"The brave  young minister became as frolicsome as a schoolboy . Mary , too , the  rosebud , forgot that her twin - blossom had ever been torn from the stem  and trampled in the dust . And as for Robert Moore , he gazed at Prudence  with the bashful earnestness of love new - born , while she , with sweet  maiden coquetry , half smiled upon and half discouraged him .  In short , it was one of those intervals when sorrow vanishes in its  own depth of shadow , and joy starts forth in transitory brightness .  When the clock struck eight , Prudence poured out her father 's customary  draught of herb tea , which had been steeping by the fireside ever since  twilight .  "" God bless you , child , "" said John Inglefield , as he took the cup from  her hand ; "" you have made your old father happy again . But we miss your  mother sadly , Prudence , sadly . It seems as if she ought to be here now . ""  "" Now , father , or never , "" replied Prudence .  It was now the hour for domestic worship . But while the family were  making preparations for this duty , they suddenly perceived that  Prudence had put on her cloak and hood , and was lifting the latch of  the door .  "" Prudence , Prudence ! where are you going ? "" cried they all with one  voice .  As Prudence passed out of the door , she turned toward them and flung  back her hand with a gesture of farewell . But her face was so changed  that they hardly recognized it . Sin and evil passions glowed through  its comeliness , and wrought a horrible deformity ; a smile gleamed in  her eyes , as of triumphant mockery , at their surprise and grief .  "" Daughter , "" cried John Inglefield , between wrath and sorrow , "" stay and  be your father 's blessing , or take his curse with you ! ""  For an instant Prudence lingered and looked back into the fire - lighted  room , while her countenance wore almost the expression as if she were  struggling with a fiend who had power to seize his victim even within  the hallowed precincts of her father 's hearth . The fiend prevailed ,  and Prudence vanished into the outer darkness . When the family rushed  to the door , they could see nothing , but heard the sound of wheels  rattling over the frozen ground .  That same night , among the painted beauties at the theatre of a  neighbouring city , there was one whose dissolute mirth seemed  inconsistent with"	1	0
"But Sin , alas ! is careful of her  bondslaves ; they hear her voice , perhaps , at the holiest moment , and  are constrained to go whither she summons them . The same dark power  that drew Prudence Inglefield from her father 's hearth -- the same in  its nature , though heightened then to a dread necessity -- would snatch  a guilty soul from the gate of heaven , and make its sin and its  punishment alike eternal .  HOW OBADIAH BROUGHT ABOUT A THANKSGIVING[16 ]  BY EMILY HEWITT LELAND .      The Waddle family had very bad luck on their farm in      the West . And they certainly were homesick ! But Obadiah      and his uncle , between them , found means to mend      matters .  THAT an innocent and helpless baby should be named Obadiah Waddle was  an outrage which the infant unceasingly resented from the time he got  old enough to realize the awful gulf that lay between his name and  those of his more fortunate mates . The experiences of his first day at  school were branded into his soul ; and although he made friends by his  bright face and kind and honest nature , scarcely a day passed during  his six years of village schooling without his absurd name flying out  at him from some unsuspected ambush and making him wince .  It was bad enough when the guying came from a boy , but when a girl took  to punning , jeering , or giggling at him it seemed as if his burden was  greater than he could bear . Then he would go home through the woods and  fields to avoid human beings , so hurt and unhappy that nothing but his  mother 's greeting and the smell of a good supper could cheer him .  At home he had no trouble . His mother and his baby sister called  him Obie , and sweet was his name on their lips . His father , who had  objected to "" Obadiah "" from the first , called him Bub or Bubby ; but one  can bear almost any name when it comes with a loving smile or a pat on  the shoulder , which was Mr. Waddle 's way of addressing his only son .  Very early in life it had been explained to Obadiah that he was named  for his mother 's favourite brother , who went to California to live ,  after hanging a silver dollar on a black silk cord round the neck of  his little namesake .  Obadiah often looked at this dollar , which was kept in a little box  with a broken earring , a hair chain , a glass breastpin , and an ancient  "" copper"	1	0
" When he was eleven years old the Waddle family moved West , and the last  thing Obadiah heard as the train pulled away from the little station  of his native town was this verse , lustily shouted from a group of  schoolmates assembled to bid him good - bye :      "" Oh , Obadiah , you 're going West ,       Where the prairie winds do n't have no rest ,       You 'll have to waddle your level best .       Good - bye , my lover , good - bye ! ""  Ill - fortune attended the Waddles in their western home . To be sure ,  they had their rich , broad acres , with never a stone or a stump to  hinder the smooth cutting plow , but a frightful midsummer storm in the  second year literally wiped out crops and cattle , and left them with  their bare lives in their lowly sod house .  "" Drought first year , tornado second . If next year 's a failure , we 'll  go back -- if we can raise money enough to go with . Three times and then  out ! "" said Mr. Waddle .  Mrs. Waddle broke down and wept . It scared the children to learn that  their mother could cry -- their mother , who was always so bright and  cheerful and who always laughed away their griefs !  Mr. Waddle was scared , too . He bent down and patted her shoulder -- his  favourite way of soothing beast or human being .  "" Now , Mary , Mary ! Do n't you go back on us . We can stand everything as  long as you are all right . Do n't feel bad ! We 'll pick up again . There 's  time enough yet to grow turnips and fodder corn . ""  "" But what will we fodder it to ? "" wailed Mrs. Waddle .  Mr. Waddle could not answer , thinking of his splendid horses , and of  his pure Jersey cows that would never answer to his call again .  "" Well , I am ashamed of myself ! "" said Mrs. Waddle , after a few moments ,  bravely drying her eyes . "" And I 'm wicked , too ! I 've just wished that  something would happen so we 'd have to go back East , and it 's happened ;  and we might have all been killed . And I 'm going to stop just where  I am . I do n't care where we live -- or how we live -- so long as we are  all together -- and well -- and there 's a crust in the house and water to  drink . ""  Rising ,"	1	0
" Do you mean to say you 've been  homesick all this time ?   "" I 'd give more for the north side of one of those old Vermont hills  than I would for the whole prairie ! "" was the emphatic reply . "" But I 'm  not going to say another single word . ""  Mr. Waddle felt a thrill of comfort in knowing he was not alone in his  yearning for the old home . It was singular that these two , who loved  each other so truly , could so hide their inmost feelings . Each had  feared to appear weak to the other .  Mr. Waddle looked at his wife with almost a radiant smile . "" Well , Mary ,  we 'll go back in the fall -- if we can sell . I guess we can hire the  Deacon Elbridge place I see by last week 's paper it 's still for sale  or rent , and carpenter work in old Hartbridge is about as profitable  for me as farming out West . ""  "" I 'm glad you would n't mind going back , Homer , "" said Mrs. Waddle , and  they looked at each other as in the days of their courtship .  But selling the farm was not easy , and October found the Waddles in  painful straits .  "" What will we have for Thanksgiving , Ma ? "" asked Obadiah .  "" Oh , a pair of nice prairie chickens , mashed turnips , hot biscuits , and  melted sugar , "" cheerfully replied Mrs. Waddle .  "" That sounds pretty good , "" said Obadiah ; but when he got out of doors  he said to himself that you could not shoot prairie chickens without  ammunition , and that he had no bait even if he tried to use his quail  traps . He also reflected that his mother looked thin and pale , that  sister Ellie needed shoes , and that plum pudding and mince pie used  to be on Thanksgiving tables . But this was the day for his story  paper -- post - office day -- which seemed to cheer things up somehow .  When he went to town for the mail he would see if his father , who was  at work carpentering on a barn , could not spare a dime for a little  powder and shot . So the boy trudged away on his long walk , with his  empty gun on his shoulder and the hope of youth in his heart .  His father , busy at work , greeted him cheerily , but had no dime for  powder and shot . Pay for the work was not to be had until the first of"	1	0
" Here 's three cents for a bite of candy for Sis , and take good care  of mother . I 'll be home day after to - morrow , likely .   Obadiah jingled the three pennies in his pocket as he walked to the  combined store and post - office . Three cents ! They would buy a charge or  two of powder and shot , and he still had a few caps . And candy was not  good for people anyhow ! He wished he had asked his father if he might  buy ammunition instead .  "" But I 'll not bother him again , "" he decided , "" and Sis will be glad  enough of the candy . ""  He would not buy rashly . He looked over the jars of striped sticks ,  peppermint drops , chocolate mice , and mixed varieties . Then he sat  down on a nail keg to await the distribution of the mail . He watched  the people standing by for the opening of the delivery window . It was  a rare thing for his family to get a letter , but then they seldom sent  one .  Once in a while a newspaper came from Uncle Obadiah , but only one  letter in two years . Perhaps if he knew what hard luck they were having  he would write oftener . The boy had heard his mother say only the week  before that she wanted to write to Brother Obie , but was no hand at  letters , especially when there was no good news to write .  A thought now came to young Obadiah . He would write to his Uncle  to - morrow , and his brain began fairly to hum with what he would say .  When his time came he invested one cent in a clean white stick of candy  and the remaining two in a postage stamp . "" I 'll pay two cents back to  pa as soon as I get the answer , "" he said confidently to his questioning  conscience .  His walk home abounded in exasperations . Never had game appeared so  plentiful . Three separate flocks of prairie chickens flew directly over  his head , a rabbit scurried across his path , and in the stubble of the  ruined grainfields rose and fell little clouds of quail .  "" They just know it ai n't loaded ! "" grumbled Obadiah , trudging with his  empty gun .  That night , after Sis had gone to sleep , and his mother had lain down  beside her , cheerfully remarking that bed was cheaper than fire , and  that she was glad there was a good wood lot on the Elbridge place ,  Obadiah ,"	1	0
"I      wish you would send me a dollar without a hole in it as      soon as you can and I will send you the one with a hole      in it . I would send it now but I have not got stamps      enough . I hope you are well . We are all well , only ma      is homesick . Your sincere nephew ,                                            OBADIAH WADDLE .      P. S.--Please send your answer right to me , because I      want to surprise ma with some things for Thanksgiving .  The next morning he set off to look at his most distant quail traps ,  found them empty , and circled round to the village , where he posted his  letter .  The days crept slowly by , and times grew more and more uncomfortable  in the little sod house . Often when Obadiah was doing his "" sums "" his  pencil would shy off to a corner of his slate and scribble a list of  items something like this :      2 cents to Pa                            $ .02      Stamps and paper ( to send the D )          .06      Powder and shot                           .10      Tea and sugar for Ma                      .30      1 lb . raisens                             .15      6 eggs                                    .08      1 lb . butter                              .20                                             -----                                               .91      More powder                               .09                                             -----                                             $ 1.00  Sometimes he would set down half a pound of "" raisens "" and add "" candy  for Sis , .05 , "" but this was in his reckless moments . Sober second  thought always convinced him that "" raisens "" would bring the greatest  good to the greatest number about Thanksgiving time .  He casually asked his mother how long it took people to go to  California .  "" Well , Uncle Obie 's newspapers always get here about four or five days  after they are printed . Dear me ! I must write to your Uncle Obie just  as soon as we can spare the money for paper and stamps . He 'll be glad  to know we are all alive and well , and that 's about all I can tell him . ""  Obadiah smiled broadly behind his geography and began reckoning the  days . The answer might arrive about the 18th , but he heroically waited  until the 21st before going to ask for it . He reached the village long  before mail time , but saw so many things to consider in the grocery  and provision line that he was almost surprised when the rattle of the  "" mail rig "" and an ingathering of people told that the important time  had arrived .  The Waddles had given up their box , so he could not"	1	0
" Others , who had mere open boxes , drew close and tried to read inverted  superscriptions with poor success . Others who never had either letters  or papers , but who came in at this hour from force of habit , stood  near the stove or leaned on the counters and spoke of the weather and  swapped feeble jokes . Finally the small wooden window was flung open .  The little group got its papers and letters and gradually retired .  "" Any letter for me ? "" cried Obadiah , his heart jumping .  "" Nope ; your pa got your papers last Saturday . ""  "" But -- ain't there a letter -- for me ? ""  The man hastily ran over the half - dozen "" W "" missives . "" Nope . ""  Obadiah 's heart was heavy as lead now . He went out into the sleety  weather and faced the long walk home . His eyes were so blurred with  tears he could hardly see and his feet came near slipping .  A derisive shout came from across the street : "" Hallo ! Pretty bad  ' waddling ' this weather ! ""  Obadiah pulled his hat over his eyes and tramped on in scornful silence .  And now another voice called out to him , a voice from the rear : "" Oh ,  say ! Waddle ! Come back here -- package for ye ! "" Obadiah hastily went  back , his heart leaping .  "" Registered package , "" explained the postmaster . "" ' Most forgot it . Sign  your name on that line . Odd name you 've got . No danger your mail going  to some other fellow . ""  Obadiah laughed and said he guessed not , and hardly believing  his senses , again started for home , and soon struck out upon the  far - stretching road . In the privacy of the great prairie he looked at  the package again . How heavy it was for such a small one , and how  important looked the long row of stamps ; and there was Uncle Obadiah 's  name in one corner , proving that it was truly the answer !  There must be a jackknife in it , or something besides the dollar . He  cut the stout twine , removed the wrapper , and lifted the cover of a  strong paper box . There was something wrapped in neat white paper and  feeling very solid .  Obadiah removed the paper , and a heavy , handsome and very fat leather  purse slipped into his hand . He opened it . It had several compartments ,  and in each one were three or more hard , flat , round objects"	1	0
" With hands fairly shaking with joy , he returned the purse to the box  and sped homeward . He ran all the way , only slowing up for breath now  and then , but it was dark , and the poor little supper was waiting when  he reached the house . The small lamp did not shed a very brilliant  light , but a mother does not need an electric glare in order to read  her child 's face .  "" Well , Obie , what 's happened ? "" asked his mother as soon as he was  inside the door . "" Have you caught a whole flock of quails ? ""  "" Something better'n quails ! Guess again , Ma ! ""  "" Three nice fat prairie hens then . ""  "" Something better'n prairie hens . "" And then Obie could wait no longer .  He pulled the package from under his coat and tossed it down beside the  poor old teapot , which had known little but hot water these many weeks .  "" Why , it 's from Brother Obie -- to _ you _ ! "" exclaimed his mother , while  his father drew near and said , "" Well , well ! ""  "" And look inside ! I have n't half looked yet , "" said Obie , "" but _ you _  look , Ma ! I just want you to look ! ""  Ma opened the box , and then the purse , and then the fourteen round  objects wrapped in white paper . And they made a fine glitter on the red  tablecloth .  "" Well , _ well _ ! "" repeated Mr. Waddle .  "" And here 's something written , "" said Mrs. Waddle , taking a paper from a  pocket at the back of the purse .  "" Read it , Ma -- out loud ! _ I _ do n't care , "" said Obie generously .  So Ma read it in a voice that trembled a little :      MY DEAR NEPHEW:--If I count rightly , it is thirteen      years since your good mother labelled you Obadiah . I 'm      not near enough to give you thirteen slaps -- I wish I      were -- so I send you thirteen dollars , and one to grow      on . Never mind returning the dollar with the hole in      it -- keep it for your grandchildren to cut their teeth      on . Give my love to your parents and little sister ; and      if you look the purse through closely , I think you will      find something of interest to your mother . It is about      time she paid our old Vermont a visit . Be a good boy .                         Your"	1	0
" Obie seized the purse and examined it on all sides . It was a very  wizard of a purse , for another little flat pocket was found in its  inmost centre , and from it Obie drew out another bit of folded paper  and opened it .  "" Why , it 's a check ! "" shouted Mr. Waddle . "" A check for you , Mary ,  for -- two -- hundred -- dollars ! My ! There 's a brother for you ! ""  "" Oh , not two _ hundred_--it must be twenty -- it ca n't be---- "" faltered  Mrs. Waddle , wiping her eyes to look at the paper .  Then she gave a little cry and fell to hugging all her family . "" We can  all go back -- we can go next week ! "" and she almost danced up and down on  the unresponsive clay floor .  "" I owe you two cents , Pa , and I 'll pay it back to you just as soon as I  can get a dollar changed , "" said Obadiah proudly , fingering the shining  coins .  "" How 's that , Bubby ? ""  Then Obadiah explained .  "" I hope you did n't complain , Obie , "" said his mother , her happy face  clouding .  "" Well , I told him about the drought and the cyclone . I guess if I was a  near relation I would n't call that complaining . And then I asked him if  he would n't swap dollars with me , so I could have one without a hole in  it to get something for Thanks---- ""  Mr. Waddle broke in with a shout of laughter , and Mrs. Waddle kissed  her son once more , and laughed , too , although her eyes were full of  tears . And then Obadiah knew everything was all right .  "" We can have Thanksgiving now , ca n't we , Ma ? "" he asked . "" It 's so near ;  and I 'm going to get all the things . We 'll have chicken pie--_tame _  chicken pie -- and plum pudding -- and butter -- and cream for the  coffee -- and cranberries -- and lump sugar -- and pumpkin pie -- and---- ""  "" Oh , me wants supper ! "" exclaimed Sis . And then they laughed again , and  fell upon the cooling cornbread and molasses and melancholy bits of  fried pork and the thin ghost of tea as if they were already engaged in  a feast of Thanksgiving . And so they were .  THE WHITE TURKEY 'S WING      Priscilla , the big white hen turkey , deserved a better      fate"	1	0
"And Thanksgivings were always merry at the  Kittredge farm on Red Hill . Uncle Kittredge might be a trifle over  thrift -- a leetle nigh , his neighbours called him -- but there was no  stinting at Thanksgiving , and when a boy is accustomed to perpetual  cornbread and sausages , he knows how to appreciate unlimited turkey  and plum pudding ; and when he is used to gloomy evenings , in which  Uncle Kittredge holds the one feeble kerosene lamp between himself and  a newspaper , Aunt Kittredge knits in silent meditation on blue yarn  stockings , he knows how good it is to have the house filled with lights  and people , jolly games going on in the parlour , and candy - pulling in  the kitchen . All these delights were directly before Jason Kittredge  as he dangled his legs from the stone wall and whittled away at the  skewers which Clorinda , the "" hired girl , "" had demanded of him , and yet  his heart was as heavy as lead .  He did not even look up when his sister Minty came up the hill toward  him . He knew it was Minty , because she was hop - skipping and humming ,  and he knew that Aunt Kittredge had sent her to Mrs. Deacon Preble 's to  get a recipe for snow pudding ; she had said she "" must have something  real stylish , because she had invited the new minister and his daughter  to dinner . ""  "" Oh , Jason , do n't you wish it was always going to be Thanksgiving Day  after to - morrow ? "" Minty continued her hop - skipping ; she went to and fro  before the dejected figure on the wall . Minty was tall for twelve , and  she had a very high forehead , which made Aunt Kittredge think that she  was going to be "" smart . "" Aunt Kittredge made her comb her hair straight  back from the high forehead , and fasten it with a round comb ; not a  vestige of hair showed under Minty 's blue hood , and her forehead looked  bleak and cold , and her pale blue eyes were watery , and her new teeth  were large and overlapped each other ; but Aunt Kittredge said it was no  matter , if she was only good and "" smart . ""  "" Why , Jason , is anything the matter ? "" Minty stopped , breathless , and  the joy faded out of her face . Jason continued to whittle in gloomy  silence . His hands were almost purple with cold , and the wind flapped  his large pantaloons -- they were Uncle Kittredge 's old ones , and Aunt"	1	0
"Jason 's tastes , as she well knew , did not incline to  ministers and schoolmasters as companions in merrymaking . "" She 's a big  girl , almost sixteen , and she will go with Mary Ellen , and we shall  have Mirandy and Augustus and the twins ; and the Sedgell girls and  Nehemiah Ham are coming in the evening , and we shall have such fun , and  such lots to eat ! ""  "" That 's just like you . You 're friv'lous . You do n't know what an awful  hard world it is . You have n't got a realizing sense , "" said Jason  crushingly .  This last accusation was one with which Aunt Kittredge was accustomed  to overwhelm Clorinda when she burned the pies or wore her best  bonnet to evening meeting . Minty 's face grew so long that it looked  like the reflection of a face in a spoon , and the tears came into her  eyes . It must be a hard world , since Jason found it so . He was much  stouter - hearted than she ; his round , snub - nosed , freckled face was  generally as cheerful as the sunshine . Jason had his troubles -- Minty  well knew what they were -- but he bore them manfully . He did n't like  to have Clorinda use his hens ' eggs when he was saving them to sell ,  and perhaps it was even more trying to be at school when the eggs man  came around , and have Aunt Kittredge sell his eggs and put the money  into her pocket . Jason wished to go into business for himself , and he  had a high opinion of the poultry business for a beginning . Cyrus ,  their "" hired man , "" had once lived with a man at North Edom who made  fabulous sums by raising poultry . But Aunt Kittredge 's peculiar views  of the rights of boys interfered with his accumulation of the necessary  capital . All these troubles Jason bore bravely . It must be some great  misfortune that caused him to look so utterly despairing , and to accuse  her of such dreadful things , thought poor Minty .  Jason took pity on her woful face . "" P'raps you 're not so much to blame ,  Mint . You do n't know , "" he said , in a somewhat softened tone . "" It 's Aunt  Kittredge . ""  Minty heaved a long , long sigh . It generally _ was _ Aunt Kittredge .  "" She 's told Cyrus to kill the -- the white turkey ! "" continued Jason , with  almost a break in his voice .  "" To"	1	0
" "" But Priscilla is yours , "" said Minty stoutly .  "" She says she only let me call her mine . Just as if I did n't save  her out of that weak brood when all the rest were killed by the  thunderstorm ! And brought her up in cotton behind the kitchen stove ,  no matter how much Clorinda scolded ! And found her nest with thirty - one  eggs in it in the old pine stump ! And she knows me and follows me  round . ""  "" I should n't think Aunt Kittredge would want to , "" said Minty  reflectively .  "" She wants a big turkey , because the minister and his daughter are  coming to dinner , and she does n't want to have one of the young ones  killed , because she is too stin---- ""  "" I would n't care if I were you . After all , Priscilla is only a turkey , ""  said Minty , attempting to be cheerful .  But this well - meant effort at consolation aroused Jason 's wrath .  "" That 's just like a girl ! "" he cried . "" What do you care if you only have  blue beads and lots of candy ? ""  Poor Minty 's face lengthened again , and her jaw fell . "" There 's my two  dollars and thirty cents , Jason , "" she said anxiously .  Jason started ; a ray of hope flushed his freckled face .  "" We can buy a big turkey over at Jonas Hicks 's for all that money , ""  continued Minty . And then she drew nearer to Jason , and added a  thrilling whisper , "" And we can hide Priscilla ! ""  Jason stared at her in amazement . He had never expected Minty to come  to the front in an emergency . Perhaps the high forehead meant something  after all . "" _ She_'ll be after you about the money , you know , "" he said ,  with a significant nod toward the house .  "" It 's my own . I earned it picking berries and weeding old Mrs.  Jackman 's garden . It 's in my bank , and the bank wo n't open till there 's  five dollars in it . ""  Jason 's face darkened .  "" But we can smash it , "" said Minty calmly .  _ Certainly _ the high forehead meant something .  Priscilla was hidden . The "" smashing "" was done in extreme privacy behind  the stone wall of the pasture . Cyrus was bound over to secrecy , as was  also Jonas Hicks , who , after some haggling , sold them his finest turkey"	1	0
" I expected nothin' but what I 'd got to pick the white turkey ,  and he 's fetched her in all picked and drawed .   "" She do n't weigh quite so much as I expected , "" said Uncle Kittredge , as  he suspended the turkey on the hook of the old steelyards .  Jason and Minty slyly exchanged anxious glances . Neither of them had  looked at the turkey , and Minty 's face was suffused with red even to  the roots of her tow - coloured hair .  Mary Ellen and Nahum came that night , and bright and early on the  morning of Thanksgiving Day came Uncle and Aunt Piper with Mirandy and  Augustus and the twins , and the house was full of noise and jollity .  Jason was obliged to go to church in the morning with the grown people ,  but Minty stayed at home to help Clorinda , and after much manoeuvring  she found an opportunity to run down to the shanty in the logging road  and feed the white turkey . The new minister and his daughter came to  dinner , and Jason and Minty were glad that the children had seats at  the far end of the table . The minister 's daughter was sixteen , and  looked very stylish , and Aunt Kittredge said she was glad enough that  they had the snow pudding , and that she had asked Aunt Piper to bring  her sauce dishes .  It had begun to be very merry at the far end of the table , in a quiet  way , for Aunt Kittredge 's stern eye wandered constantly in that  direction , and Jason and Minty had almost forgotten that there were  trials and difficulties in life , when suddenly Aunt Piper 's loud voice  sounded across the table , striking terror to their souls :  "" You do n't say that this is the white turkey ? Seems kind of a pity to  kill her , she was so handsome . But she eats real well . Now , you must n't  forget to let me take a wing home to Sabriny . You know you always  promised her a wing for her hat when the white turkey was killed . ""  Sabriny was Aunt Piper 's niece , who had been left at home to keep house .  "" Sure enough I did , "" said Aunt Kittredge . "" Jason , you go out to the  barn and get Cyrus to give you one of the white turkey 's wings ; and  Minty , you wrap it up nice , so it will be handy for your aunt to  carry . Go as soon as you 've ate your dinner , so 's to"	1	0
"He could scarcely eat another mouthful , and Minty found it  unexpectedly easy to obey Aunt Kittredge 's injunction to decline snow  pudding lest there should not be "" enough to go round . ""  "" What are you going to do ? "" asked Minty , overtaking Jason , as he walked  dejectedly through the woodshed as soon as dinner was over .  "" I do n't know ; run away and be a cowboy like Hiram Trickey , I guess . ""  Minty 's heart gave a great throb . Hiram Trickey had sent home a  photograph , which showed him to have become very like the picture of a  pirate in Cyrus 's old book , with pistols and a dirk at his belt .  "" Jason , the new minister 's daughter has got a white gull 's wing on her  hat , and -- it 's up in the spare chamber on the bed , and I do n't think  Sabriny would ever know the difference . ""  Jason stared in mild - eyed speechless wonder . Minty had never shown  herself a leading spirit before .  "" It will be dark before the minister 's daughter goes , and there 's a  veil over the hat , and if we put a little something white on it I 'm  sure she wo n't notice . And when she does notice she wo n't know what  became of it . And we can save up and buy her another gull 's wing . ""  "" Sabriny'll know , "" said Jason , but there was an accent of hope in his  voice .  "" They do n't have turkeys , and they know that Priscilla was n't a common  turkey ; perhaps they wo n't know the difference , "" said Minty . "" Anyway ,  it will give us time to get Priscilla out of the way . If Aunt Kittredge  finds out , she will have her killed right away . ""  "" You go and get the wing off the minister 's daughter 's hat , Mint , ""  directed Jason firmly .  Minty worked with trembling fingers in the chilly seclusion of the  spare chamber , but she made a neat package . And she stuck on to the hat  in place of the wing some feathers from the white rooster .  There was an awful moment as Uncle and Aunt Piper were leaving .  "" Just let me see whether he 's got a real handsome wing , "" said Aunt  Kittredge , taking the package which Minty had put into Aunt Piper 's  hand .  "" Malachi is in considerable of a hurry , and they 've done it up so  nice , "" said"	1	0
"  There was another dreadful moment when the minister 's daughter went  home . They had played games until a very late hour , for Corinna , and  she dressed so hurriedly that she did not observe that anything had  happened to her hat , but as she went down the garden walk Jason and  Minty saw in the moonlight the rooster 's feathers blowing from it .  The next morning , in the privacy afforded by the great woodpile , to  which Jason had gone to chop his daily stint , the children debated the  advisability of committing the white turkey to the care of Lot Rankin ,  who lived with his widowed mother on the edge of the woods .   It 's hard to get a chance to feed her , "" said Jason , "" and she may  squawk . ""  "" Lot Rankin may tell , "" suggested Minty . And she heaved a great sigh .  Conspiracy came hard to Minty .  Just then the voice of the new minister 's daughter came to their ears .  She was talking with Aunt Kittredge on the other side of the woodpile .  "" There was a high wind last night when I went home , and I suppose it  blew away . I am very sorry to lose it , because it was so pretty , and it  was a present , too , "" she said .  "" Maybe the children have found it ; they 're round everywhere , "" said Aunt  Kittredge . And then she called shrilly to Jason .  Minty shrank down in a little heap behind a huge log as Jason stepped  bravely out from behind the woodpile , and answered promptly that he had  not seen the gull 's wing . That was literally true ; but how _ she _ was  going to answer , Minty did not know .  It was so great a relief that tears sprang to Minty 's eyes when , after  a little more conversation , the minister 's daughter went away . Aunt  Kittredge had taken it for granted that , as she remarked , "" if one of  them young ones did n't know anything about it the other did n't . ""  Minty felt her burden of guilt to be greater than she could bear .  And there was no way in which she could earn money enough to buy the  minister 's daughter a new feather until berries were ripe and the weeds  grew in old Mrs. Jackman 's garden . Minty racked her brains to think of  something she could give the minister 's daughter to ease her troubled  conscience . There was her Bunker Hill monument , made of shells , her"	1	0
"Minty felt ,  despairingly , that this atonement was impossible .  But suddenly a bright idea struck her . The feather on her summer Sunday  hat ! It was blue -- it had been white originally , but Aunt Kittredge  had thriftily had it dyed when it became soiled . Blue would be very  becoming to the minister 's daughter , and perhaps she would like it as  well as her gull 's wing . There was another sly visit to the chilly  spare chamber . Minty took the summer Sunday hat from its bandbox in  the closet , and carefully abstracted the blue feather . It was slightly  faded , and there were some traces of the wetting it had received in  a thunderstorm in spite of the handkerchief which Aunt Kittredge  carefully pinned over it ; but Minty thought it still a very beautiful  feather . She put it into a little pasteboard box , wrote the minister 's  daughter 's name on it , placed it on her doorstep at dusk , rang the  bell , and ran away .  It was nearly a week before she could find this opportunity to present  the feather , for Aunt Kittredge did n't allow her to go out after  dark ; and in all that time they had not been able to negotiate with  Lot Rankin , for Lot had the mumps on both sides at once , and could  not be seen . But the very next day after the minister 's daughter  received her feather -- as if things were all coming right , thought  Minty hopefully -- Uncle Kittredge sent her down to Lot Rankin 's to find  out when he would be strong enough to help Cyrus in the logging camp ;  and Jason gave her many charges concerning the contract she was to  make with Lot . But as she was going out of the house , there stood the  minister 's daughter in the doorway , talking with Aunt Kittredge .  "" I should n't have known where it came from if Miss Plympton , the  milliner , had n't happened to come in , "" the young girl was saying . "" She  said at once , ' It 's Minty Kittredge 's feather . I had it dyed for her  last summer , and there 's the little tag from the dye - house on it now . '  I ca n't think why she sent it to me . ""  Aunt Kittredge turned to the shrinking figure behind her , holding the  blue feather accusingly in her hand .  "" Araminta Kittredge , what does this mean ? "" she demanded sternly .  "" I -- I -- she felt so bad about her gull 's"	1	0
" "" It 's my duty to find out just what this means , "" said Aunt Kittredge  severely . "" I never heard of a child doing such a high - handed thing ! You  can do your errand now , because your uncle wants you to , but when you  come back I shall have a settlement with you . ""  Poor Minty ! She ran fast , never looking back , although the minister 's  daughter called to her in kindliest tones .  There was no hope of keeping a secret from Aunt Kittredge when once  she had discovered that there was one . The only chance of saving  Priscilla 's life lay in persuading Lot Rankin to care for and conceal  her .  But , alas ! she found that Lot was not to be persuaded . He was going  into the woods to work , and his mother was "" set against turkeys . ""  Moreover , she was "" so lonesome most of the time that when folks _ did _  come along she told 'em all she knew . ""  Jason , who had been very anxious , met her at the corner . Perhaps it was  not to be wondered at that Jason was somewhat cross and unreasonable .  He said only a girl would be so foolish as to send that feather to the  minister 's daughter . Girls were all silly , even those who had high  foreheads , and he would never trust one again . He hoped she was going  to have sense enough not to tell , no matter what Aunt Kittredge did .  Poor Minty felt herself to be quite unequal to resisting Aunt  Kittredge , but she swallowed a lump in her throat and said firmly that  she would try to have sense enough .  As they passed the blacksmith 's shop , Liphlet , Uncle Piper 's man ,  called out to them : "" Mebbe I sha n't have time to go up to your house .  The blacksmith is sick , so I had to come over here to get the mare  shod , and I wish you 'd tell your aunt that Sabriny says ' twan't no  turkey 's wing that she sent her : ' twas some kind of a sea - bird 's wing ,  and it come off of somebody 's bunnit , and she 's a - goin ' to fetch it  back ! ""  Minty and Jason answered not a word , but as they went on they looked at  each other despairingly .  "" We should have been found out anyway , "" said Minty .  Her pitifully white face seemed to touch Jason and arouse a spark of  manly courage"	1	0
"You ca n't help being a  girl , "" he said magnanimously . "" And I wo n't run away to be a cowboy like  Hiram Trickey . ""  Minty gave him a little grateful glance , but she could not speak . It  did not seem so dreadful now about Hiram Trickey . She wished that a  girl could run away to be a cowboy .  As they slowly and dejectedly drew near the house , they saw a horse and  a farm wagon at the door , and through the window they discovered that  Uncle and Aunt Kittredge , Clorinda , and Cyrus were all in the kitchen .  There was a visitor . Here was at least a slight reprieve . They went  around through the woodshed ; it seemed advisable to approach Aunt  Kittredge with caution , even in the presence of a visitor .  "" Well , I must say I 'm consid'able disappointed , "" the visitor was  saying , as they softly opened the door . He was a bluff , burly man , who  sat with his tall whip between his knees . "" I ought to ' a ' stopped when  I see her out there top of the stone wall the last time I come by -- the  handsomest turkey cretur I ever did see , and I 've been in the poultry  business this twenty years . I knew in a minute she belonged to that  breed that old Mis ' Joskins had ; she fetched 'em from York State . She  moved away before I knew it , and carried 'em all with her . ""  "" I bought some eggs of her , and ' most all of 'em hatched , but that  white turkey was the only one that lived , "" said Aunt Kittredge . "" I  declare if I 'd known she was anything more'n common , and worthy of  havin' her picture in a book---- ""  "" You 'd ought to have known it , Maria ! "" said Uncle Kittredge testily . "" I  wa'n't for havin' her killed , and you 'd ought to have heard to me ! ""  "" I was calc'latin ' to hev her picter right in the front of my new  poultry book , "" continued the visitor , whom the children now recognized  as the distinguished poultry dealer of North Edom for whom Cyrus had  once worked . "" And I was going to have printed under it , ' From the farm  of Abner Kittredge , Esq . , Corinna . ' Be kind of a boom for you ' n '  Corinna , too -- see ? And if you did n't want to sell her right out , I was "	1	0
" "" Oh , oh ! Uncle Kittredge ! "" Minty broke away from Jason , who would have  held her back , not feeling sure that it was quite time to speak , and  rushed into the room . "" You need n't give twenty dollars ! Priscilla is  down in the little shanty in the logging wood ! We saved her -- Jason  and I -- and we bought a turkey of Jonas Hicks instead . I paid with my  own money , Aunt Kittredge ! And then I -- I took the gull 's wing off the  minister 's daughter 's hat to send to Sabriny , and -- and so that 's why I  sent her the blue feather , and -- and Sabriny 's going to send the gull 's  wing back---- ""  "" Jason , you go and fetch that turkey home ! "" said Uncle Kittredge . "" And ,  Maria , do n't you blame them children one mite ! ""  "" I never heard of such high - handed doin 's ! "" gasped Aunt Kittredge .  "" I expect I shall have to send you children each a copy of my book with  the picter of that turkey in it , "" said the poultry dealer . "" And maybe  the boy and I can make kind of a contract about eggs and chickens . ""  The minister 's daughter wore her gull 's wing to church the next Sunday ,  and she privately confided to Minty that she "" did n't blame her one  bit . "" Aunt Kittredge looked at Minty somewhat severely for several  days but only as she looked at her when she turned around in church or  fidgeted in the long prayer . And after the poultry book came out with  Priscilla 's photograph as a frontispiece , and people began to make  pilgrimages to the Red Hill farm to see the poultry , she was heard to  say several times that "" it was wonderful to see how a smart boy like  Jason could make turkey raising pay , "" and that "" as for Minty , she  always knew that high forehead of hers was n't for nothing . ""  THE THANKSGIVING GOOSE      How a little boy learned to be thankful . A charming      story even though it _ has _ a moral .  "" BUT I do n't like roast goose , "" said Guy , pouting . "" I 'd rather  have turkey . Turkey is best for Thanksgiving , anyway . Goose is for  Christmas . ""  Guy 's mother did not answer . He watched her while she carefully wrote  G. T. W. on the corner of a pretty new red - bordered handkerchief . Five "	1	0
" Mrs. Wright smiled a queer little smile , but did not answer . She  lighted a large lamp and held the marked corner of one of the  handkerchiefs against the hot chimney . The heat made the indelible ink  turn dark , although the writing had been so faint Guy hardly could see  it before .  "" Oh , dear , "" he cried , "" there 's a little blot at the top of that T ! I  do n't want to carry a handkerchief that has a blot on it . ""  "" Very well , "" said his mother . "" I 'll put them away , and you may carry  your old ones until you ask me to let you carry this one . I do n't care  to furnish new things for a boy who does n't appreciate them .

Tell her that  I shall have a day 's work for her on Friday , and I thought she might  like to have part of the pay in advance to help make Thanksgiving with .  Please go now . ""  "" But a dollar wo n't help much . She wo n't like that . She always acts  just as if she was as happy as anybody . I do n't want to go there on  such an errand as that . ""  Mrs. Wright smiled again , but her tone was very grave .  "" Mrs. Burns is ' as happy as anybody , ' Guy , and she has the best - behaved  children in the neighbourhood . The little ones almost never cry , and I  never have seen the older ones quarrel . But there are eight children ,  and Mr. Burns has only one arm , so he ca n't earn much money . Mrs. Burns  has to turn her hands to all sorts of things to keep the children  clothed and fed . She 'll be thankful to get the dollar -- you see if she  is n't ! And tell her if she is making mince pies to sell this year , I 'll  take three . ""  Guy walked very slowly down the street until he came to the little  house where the Burns family lived .  "" I 'd hate to live here , "" he thought . "" I do n't see where they all  sleep . My room is n't big enough , but I do n't believe there 's a room in  this house as big as mine . I"	1	0
"  Then he knocked on the front door , for there was no bell . No one came .  He could hear people talking in the distance , so he knew some of the  family were at home . Some one always was at home here to look after the  little children . He walked around to the kitchen door : it stood open .  The children were talking so fast they did not hear his knock .  They were very busy . Katie , the eleven - year - old , and Malcolm , ten ,  Guy 's age , were cutting citron into long , thin strips , piling it on a  big blue plate . Mary and James , the eight - year - old twins , were paring  apples with a paring machine . The long , curling skins fell in a large  stone jar standing on a clean paper , spread on the floor . Charlie , who  was only four years old , was watching to see that none of the parings  fell over the edge of the jar . Susan , who was seven , was putting  raisins , a few at a time , into a meat chopper screwed down on the  kitchen table . George , three years old , was turning the handle of the  chopper to grind the raisins . Baby Joe was creeping about the kitchen  floor after a kitten . Mrs. Burns was taking a great piece of meat from  a steaming kettle on the back of the stove . Every one was working ,  except the baby and the kitten , but all seemed to be having a glorious  time . What they were saying seemed so funny it was some time before  Guy could understand it . At last he was sure it was some kind of a game .   Mice ? "" asked Susan . Mary squealed , and they all laughed .  "" Because they 're small , "" said Mary . "" Snakes ? ""  "" They ca n't climb trees , "" Mrs. Burns called out from the pantry . The  children fairly roared at that . "" A pantry with no window in it ? ""  "" Oh , we 've had that before , "" Katie answered . "" I know what you say . It 's  a good place to ripen pears in when Mrs. Wright gives us some . ""  Guy knocked very loudly at that . He had not thought that he was  listening .  The children started , but did not leave their work . They looked at  their mother . "" Jamie , "" she said . Then Jamie came to meet Guy , and  invited him to walk in . "	1	0
"  Guy said  Thank you "" and began to turn the parer eagerly .  "" But I do n't mean what you are doin' , "" said Guy . "" I knew that was mince  pies . I thought that was work . I meant what you were saying . It sounds  so funny ! I never heard it before . ""  "" Mamma made it up , "" explained Malcolm . "" It 's great fun . We always play  it at Thanksgiving time . You think of something that people do n't like ,  and the one who can think first tells what he is thankful for about it .  We call it ' Thanksgiving . ' ""  Guy stayed for an hour , and played both games . Then , quite to his  surprise , the twelve o'clock whistles blew , and he had to go home . But  he remembered his errands and did them , to the great pleasure of the  whole Burns family .  In the afternoon Guy spent some time writing a note to his mother . It  was badly written , but it made his mother happy . It read :      DEAR MOTHER:--I am Thankful the blot isent any bigger .      I am Thankful the hankershefs isent black on the      borders . I would like that one with the Blot on to put      in my pocket when you read this . But my old ones are      nice . The Burnses do nt have things to be Thankful for      but they are Thankful just the same .      I am Thankful for the Goose we are going to have . The      best is I am Thankful I am not a Goose myself , for if I      was I wouldent know enough to be Thankful .                                Respectfully yours ,                                          GUY THEODORE WRIGHT .  AN ENGLISH DINNER OF THANKSGIVING      Americans are not the only people who hold a feast each      year after the crops are gathered into barns .      The older boys and girls who wish to know more of the      jolly English farmer , Martin Poyser , and his household ,      will enjoy reading about them in George Eliot 's great      novel , "" Adam Bede . ""  IT WAS a goodly sight -- that table , with Martin Poyser 's round  good - humoured face and large person at the head of it , helping his  servants to the fragrant roast beef , and pleased when the empty  plates came again . Martin , though usually blest with a good appetite ,  really forgot to finish his own beef to - night -- it was so pleasant to  him to look on in the intervals of carving , and see how the others  enjoyed"	1	0
"He held his head on one  side , and screwed up his mouth , as he nudged Bartle Massey , and watched  half - witted Tom Tholer , otherwise known as "" Tom Saft , "" receiving his  second plateful of beef . A grin of delight broke over Tom 's face as the  plate was set down before him , between his knife and fork , which he  held erect , as if they had been sacred tapers ; but the delight was too  strong to continue smouldering in a grin -- it burst out the next moment  in a long - drawn "" haw , haw ! "" followed by a sudden collapse into utter  gravity , as the knife and fork darted down on the prey . Martin Poyser 's  large person shook with his silent unctuous laugh ; he turned toward  Mrs. Poyser to see if she , too , had been observant of Tom , and the eyes  of husband and wife met in a glance of good - natured amusement .  But _ now _ the roast beef was finished and the cloth was drawn , leaving  a fair large deal table for the bright drinking cans , and the foaming  brown jugs , and the bright brass candlesticks , pleasant to behold .  _ Now _ the great ceremony of the evening was to begin -- the harvest  song , in which every man must join ; he might be in tune , if he liked  to be singular , but he must not sit with closed lips . The movement was  obliged to be in triple time ; the rest was _ ad libitum _ .  As to the origin of this song -- whether it came in its actual state  from the brain of a single rhapsodist , or was gradually perfected  by a school or succession of rhapsodists , I am ignorant . There is a  stamp of unity , of individual genius upon it , which inclines me to  the former hypothesis , though I am not blind to the consideration  that this unity may rather have arisen from that consensus of many  minds which was a condition of primitive thought foreign to our modern  consciousness . Some will perhaps think that they detect in the first  quatrain an indication of a lost line , which later rhapsodists , failing  in imaginative vigour , have supplied by the feeble device of iteration ;  others , however , may rather maintain that this very iteration is an  original felicity to which none but the most prosaic minds can be  insensible .  The ceremony connected with the song was a drinking ceremony . ( That  is perhaps a painful fact , but then , you know , we"	1	0
"  But now , immediately before the third quatrain or chorus , sung  _ fortissimo _ , with emphatic raps on the table , which gave the effect of  cymbals and drum together , Alick 's can was filled , and he was bound to  empty it before the chorus ceased .       Then drink , boys , drink !         And see ye do not spill ,       For if ye do , ye shall drink two ,         For ' tis our master 's will . ""  When Alick had gone successfully through this test of steady - handed  manliness , it was the turn of old Kester , at his right hand -- and so on ,  till every man had drunk his initiatory pint under the stimulus of the  chorus . Tom Saft -- the rogue -- took care to spill a little by accident ;  but Mrs. Poyser ( too officiously , Tom thought ) interfered to prevent  the exaction of the penalty .  To any listener outside the door it would have been the reverse of  obvious why the "" Drink , boys , drink ! "" should have such an immediate  and often - repeated encore ; but once entered , he would have seen that  all faces were at present sober , and most of them serious ; it was the  regular and respectable thing for those excellent farm - labourors to  do , as much as for elegant ladies and gentlemen to smirk and bow over  their wine glasses . Bartle Massey , whose ears were rather sensitive ,  had gone out to see what sort of evening it was at an early stage in  the ceremony ; and had not finished his contemplation , until a silence  of five minutes declared that "" Drink , boys , drink ! "" was not likely to  begin again for the next twelve - month . Much to the regret of the boys  and Totty ; on them the stillness fell rather flat , after that glorious  thumping of the table , toward which Totty , seated on her father 's knee ,  contributed with her small might and small fist .  When Bartle re√´ntered , however , there appeared to be a general desire  for solo music after the choral . Nancy declared that Tim the wagoner  knew a song and was "" allays singing like a lark i ' the stable "" ;  whereupon Mr. Poyser said encouragingly , "" Come , Tim , lad , let 's hear  it . "" Tim looked sheepish , tucked down his head , and said he could n't  sing ; but this encouraging invitation of the master 's was echoed all  round the table . It was a conversational opportunity :"	1	0
" A good - tempered wagoner 's patience has limits , and Tim was  not to be urged further .   Well , then , David , ye're the lad to sing , "" said Ben , willing to show  that he was not discomfited by this check . "" Sing ' My loove 's a roos  wi'out a thorn . ' ""  The amatory David was a young man of an unconscious abstracted  expression , which was due probably to a squint of superior intensity  rather than to any mental characteristic ; for he was not indifferent to  Ben 's invitation , but blushed and laughed and rubbed his sleeve over  his mouth in a way that was regarded as a symptom of yielding . And for  some time the company appeared to be much in earnest about the desire  to hear David 's song . But in vain . The lyrism of the evening was in  the cellar at present , and was not to be drawn from that retreat just  yet ....  A NOVEL POSTMAN      A little country girl made known her wants in a      decidedly original way . A small boy in the city did      his best to satisfy them . This is at once a story of      Thanksgiving and of Christmas .  "" OH , MOTHER ! what do you suppose Ellen found in the turkey ? You  never could guess . It 's a letter -- yes , a real letter just stuffed  inside -- see ! "" And Freddie held before his mother 's wondering eyes a  soiled and crumpled envelope which seemed to contain a letter .  Freddie had been in the kitchen all the morning watching the various  operations for the Thanksgiving dinner which was "" to come off "" the next  day , when all the "" sisters , cousins , and aunts "" of the family were to  assemble , as was their custom each year , and great was the commotion in  the kitchen and much there was for Master Fred to inspect . When Ellen  put her hand into the turkey to arrange him for the stuffing , great  was her astonishment at finding a piece of paper . Drawing it quickly  out she called , "" Freddie , Freddie , see here ! See what I 've found in  the turkey ! I declare if he is n't a new kind of a postman , for sure as  you 're born this is a letter , come from somewhere , in the turkey . My !  who ever heard of such a thing ? ""  Freddie , standing with eyes and mouth wide open , finally said , "" Why ,  Ellen , do you believe it is a letter ?"	1	0
" His mother took the letter from him . "" Where did you get this ,  Freddie -- what do you mean by finding it in the turkey ? ""  "" Why , Ellen found it in the turkey when she was fixing him , and I do n't  see how it got there . ""  Mrs. Page turned the envelope and slowly read , "" To the lady who buys  this turkey , "" written with a pencil and in rather crooked letters on  the outside ; then opening the envelope she found , surely enough , a  letter within , also written in pencil , in rather uncertain letters ,  some large , some quite small , some on the line , others above or below ,  but all bearing sufficient relation to one another for her finally to  decipher the following :                                    _ Nov. 20 ,                                Mad River Village , N. H. _      dere lady I doo want a dol for Christmas orful and      mother says that Sante Claws is so busy in the city      that she gueses he forgits the cuntry and for me to      rite to the city lady who buys our turkey and ask her      if she will pleas to ask Sante Claws if he could send      a dol way up here in the cuntry to me . I will hang my      stockin in the chimly and he can not mistake the house      becaus it is the only house that is black in the hole      place . I have prayed to him lots of times to give me      a dol but I gues he does not mind prayers much from a      little girl so far away so will you pleas to ask him      for me and oblige                                             LUCY TILLAGE .      P. S.--I hope the turkey will be good to eat , he is our      very best one and I was sorry to have him killed , but I      never had a dol .  Freddie listened , very much interested , sometimes helping to make  out the letters while his mother read this remarkable letter . At  its conclusion he dropped upon a chair in deep thought while in his  imagination he saw a small black house surrounded by turkeys running  wildly about while a little girl tried to catch the largest .  "" Oh , mother , "" at length he sighed , "" only think of a girl who never  had a doll , and Beth has so many she do n't know what to do with them  all -- shall you ask Santa Claus to send her one ? ""  "" Well , "" said Mrs. Page , who also had been in deep thought , "" do you  think we better ask Santa"	1	0
" He seemed  to think the house was little because the girl was little .   No , no , Freddie , not so fast , "" said Mrs. Page . "" I think we better wait  till papa comes home and then we will ask his advice about it : first ,  if he knows of a town in New Hampshire of this name , and then if he  thinks there may really be a little girl there who has such an odd  name -- I should n't be surprised if Papa could find out all about her . ""  Freddie thought it was hard to wait until his father came home before  something was done about securing a doll ; still he knew his mother was  right and tried to be patient , wishing Beth would come home , wondering  how the little girl looked , and if she had any brothers who wanted  something , and fifty other things , till he heard his father 's key in  the front door ; then down he rushed , flourishing the open sheet in his  hand , and gave him a most bewildering and rapid account of the letter  and the finding it in the turkey , ending with , "" Now , Papa , do you know  of any such town , and did you ever hear of Lucy Tillage before , or of  anybody 's turkey having a letter sent in him , and do n't you think we  might send her the doll right away so 's she might have it for Christmas  sure -- don't you , Papa ? And if we ca n't get a new one wo n't you tell  Beth to send one of hers ? I know she wo n't want so many and---- ""  "" Oh ! stop , my boy , "" said Mr. Page , laughing heartily ; "" wait a moment ,  Fred , I do n't half understand what this is all about -- a letter and a  turkey and a little girl with a doll and a turkey in a black house---- ""  "" Now , Papa , you 're getting it all mixed up ; you read the letter  yourself , please . ""  So Mr. Page read the letter and heard about finding it in the turkey ,  and then talked it over with his wife and Freddie and Beth , who had  come in from her play , and it was decided that he should write to the  postmaster and minister in Mad River Village asking them if they knew  of any family in the place of the name of Tillage , and if they did ,  whether they were a poor family , and how many children they had , and"	1	0
" Then came a long time of waiting for Master Fred . At first he thought  one day would be enough for the letter to find its way to Mad River  Village ; but upon a solemn consultation with the cousins and aunts  who came to the Thanksgiving party , it was decided that three days ,  at least , ought to be allowed for a letter to reach a place that none  of them had ever heard of , and perhaps there was not such a village  anywhere after all ; but Freddie had made up his mind that there was  somewhere , and so each morning found him watching for the postman and  each night he went to bed disappointed , saying , "" Oh ! I hope there is a  truly Mad Village . ""  Beth was almost as much excited as Fred about Lucy 's letter , but still  she laughed at him as older sisters sometimes seem to take pleasure in  doing , saying , "" I guess it 's a delicious wonderland kind of a letter ,  and that the people up there are mad people to be sending letters in  turkeys ! ""  "" Well , you just wait , Beth , and see if they are , "" answered Fred ;  and sure enough , after ten days of waiting Freddie was rewarded by  receiving from the postman a yellow envelope with "" Mad River Village ""  printed in large , clear letters "" right side of the stamp . "" He ran as  fast as he could with it to his father , shouting to Beth by the way to  "" come and see if there is n't a Mad Village and a Lucy Tillage . ""  Mr. Page was never given so short a time before to open a letter and  adjust his glasses , but then a letter had never before been received  under such circumstances . It proved to be from the postmaster at Mad  River Village , and ran as follows :                                _ Mad River Village , N. H. _      MR . PAGE of Boston : I rec . your letter a Day or two      since and hasten to ans . it right away , as you wish ,      by this morning 's mail which I must put up pretty soon      so this letter must be short . Yes sir I do know a      family in this town by the name of Tillage and they 're      a good respectable family too . They live a mile or      two out of the village on a farm his father left him      and I guess they have pretty hard times making both      ends meet -- there ai n't much sale up here for farm      things"	1	0
"They 're young folks , got three children , a      little girl a small boy and a baby and I guess they 'll      do as well as any one can on that farm , it 's a likely      place but his father ai n't been dead long and Geo .      did n't have no show while the old man was alive . He      buys his flour and groceries of me and I call him a      honest fellow and I guess you 'd like to board with them      if you want to try them next summer . I do n't think of      anything more to say so will close .                                     Yours respt .                                           JOSIAH SAFFORD .      P. S.--His name and address are George Tillage ,      Intervale Farm , Mad River Village , N. H.  This was a highly satisfactory letter , especially to Master Fred who  had shouted gleefully to Beth , "" I told you so ! "" "" I do know a family  of the name of Tillage , "" and when his father read "" three children , a  little girl , etc . , "" he nearly turned a somersault in his excitement ,  dancing about and saying , "" that 's Lucy ! that 's Lucy ! ""  Mr. Page turned smilingly to his wife , saying , "" Well , my dear , this  does not sound so much like a fairy tale after all , and I really think  you and the children must play Santa Claus and send Lucy a doll . ""  "" Oh , yes , Papa , of course we must ! Yes , do , Mamma ! "" shouted both  children at once . "" It 'll be such fun and she wo n't know where it comes  from . ""  Mrs. Page was only too willing , so she promised , only adding that she  hoped the minister would give an equally good account .  The children , however , were quite satisfied with the postmaster 's  letter and began preparations the very next morning to secure the doll  and her "" fit out "" as Beth called it . First , Beth 's dolls were looked  at to see if one of them would do to take a trip into the country , but  although there were quite a number of them none seemed to just suit  their ideas of what Lucy 's doll should be . So Mamma was appealed to  and in consequence a visit was paid to Partridge 's store by Mrs. Page ,  accompanied by Beth and Master Fred . Here such a bewildering array of  dolls was presented to the children that it was with difficulty they  finally decided upon one with blue eyes and short golden"	1	0
" Freddie thought the "" small boy "" and the "" baby "" ought to have presents  sent to them also ; so he was allowed to select a drum , which he was  sure the boy "" would like best of anything , "" and a pretty rattle and a  rubber cow for the baby .  It was a very busy season of the year for the Pages as well as for  other people , and Beth had many presents to think about , but she kept  the little dresses and clothes for Lucy 's doll in mind and worked and  planned with a will all the time she could spare for them , and Mary ,  the seamstress , sewed and sewed , and as she knew how to cut dresses as  well as make them , in about two weeks they had , as Beth said , "" a lovely  fit out , "" even to a tiny muff and collar made from some bits of fur  mamma had and a sweet little hood made just like Beth 's own .  Then Miss Doll was dressed in her travelling suit , muff and all , her  other dresses and clothing packed in the little trunk , and she herself  carefully tucked in on top , then Beth shut the cover and locked it ,  tying the key to one of the buckles of the side strap -- a box had been  procured and into it was packed the trunk , the drum , and the presents  for the baby , supplemented by Freddie with a ball which he had found  among his own playthings and two cornucopias of candy which he had  purchased himself , saying that "" Christmas wo n't be Christmas if they  do n't have some candy . "" Mrs. Page "" filled in the nooks and corners just  to steady the whole , "" as she modestly said , with a pair of strong warm  mittens for Mr. Tillage , some magazines and books , several pairs of  long thick stockings which Freddie had outgrown but not worn out , and  over the whole a beautiful warm shawl .  Then Beth and Fred composed a letter together which Beth wrote and they  both signed :      DEAR LUCY TILLAGE:--The turkey brought the letter      safely to us and we wanted to be Santa Claus ourselves      and so send the doll and the other things for a      Christmas present to you and your brother and the baby .      We wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year .                                               BETH PAGE ,                                               FRED PAGE .  This they neatly folded , put in an envelope addressed to Miss Lucy  Tillage , Mad River Village , and placed on the shawl"	1	0
" Freddie insisted that Lucy 's name ought to be put on , too , as she was  the one who had written the letter and to whom the box was really  sent ; so "" For Lucy "" was printed across one corner and underlined that  her father might see it was sent particularly to her . It all seemed  so mysterious , sending presents to people they did not know , and so  delightful , that they thought this the best Christmas they had ever  known and only wished that they could be in the little "" black house ""  when the box was opened , to see Lucy 's face as she caught sight of the  cunning trunk and then the doll which she had so longed for .  The very day the box was sent on its way there came a letter from a  minister in the town in which Mad River Village was located , saying  that he "" did not know any family of the name of Tillage , but upon  inquiry he had found that there was a family of that name living on the  other side of the river , but as they did not go to his church he was  not acquainted with them ; he was sorry , etc . , etc . ""  But the children cared little for this letter ; their faith in Lucy was  not shaken , and they were very happy that they had answered her letter .  EZRA 'S THANKSGIVIN ' OUT WEST      A Kansas settler 's recollections of an oldtime      Thanksgiving in western Massachusetts . Older boys and      girls will best appreciate the tender sentiment of the      picture which Eugene Field has painted so vividly by      his masterly use of homely dialect .  EZRA had written a letter to the home folks , and in it he had  complained that never before had he spent such a weary , lonesome day  as this Thanksgiving Day had been . Having finished this letter , he sat  for a long time gazing idly into the open fire that snapped cinders all  over the hearthstone and sent its red forks dancing up the chimney to  join the winds that frolicked and gambolled across the Kansas prairies  that raw November night . It had rained hard all day , and was cold ; and  although the open fire made every honest effort to be cheerful , Ezra ,  as he sat in front of it in the wooden rocker and looked down into  the glowing embers , experienced a dreadful feeling of loneliness and  homesickness .  "" I 'm sick o ' Kansas , "" said Ezra to himself . "" Here I 've been in this  plaguey country for goin' on"	1	0
"I wish I was back in ol'  Mass'chusetts -- that 's the country for _ me _ , and they hev the kind o '  Thanksgivin ' I like ! ""  Musing in this strain , while the rain went patter - patter on the  windowpanes , Ezra saw a strange sight in the fireplace -- yes , right  among the embers and the crackling flames Ezra saw a strange , beautiful  picture unfold and spread itself out like a panorama .  "" How very wonderful ! "" murmured the young man . Yet he did not take his  eyes away , for the picture soothed him and he loved to look upon it .  "" It is a pictur ' of long ago , "" said Ezra softly . "" I had like to forgot  it , but now it comes back to me as nat'ral - like as an ol' friend . An ' I  seem to be a part of it , an ' the feelin ' of that time comes back with  the pictur ' , too . ""  Ezra did not stir . His head rested upon his hand , and his eyes were  fixed upon the shadows in the firelight .  "" It is a pictur ' of the ol' home , "" said Ezra to himself . "" I am back  there in Belchertown , with the Holyoke hills up north an ' the Berkshire  Mountains a - loomin ' up gray an ' misty - like in the western horizon .  Seems as if it wuz early mornin ' ; everything is still , and it is so  cold when we boys crawl out o ' bed that , if it wuzn't Thanksgivin '  mornin ' , we 'd crawl back again an ' wait for Mother to call us . But it  _ is _ Thanksgivin ' mornin ' , and we 're goin' skatin ' down on the pond .  The squealin ' o ' the pigs has told us it is five o'clock , and we must  hurry ; we 're goin' to call by for the Dickerson boys an ' Hiram Peabody ,  an ' we 've got to hyper ! Brother Amos gets on about half o ' my clothes ,  and I get on 'bout half o ' his , but it 's all the same ; they are stout ,  warm clo'es , and they 're big enough to fit any of us boys -- Mother  looked out for that when she made 'em . When we go downstairs , we find  the girls there , all bundled up nice an ' warm -- Mary an ' Helen an '  Cousin Irene . They 're going with us , an ' we all start out tiptoe"	1	0
"When we come to  the minister 's house , Laura is standin ' on the front stoop a - waitin '  for us . Laura is the minister 's daughter . She 's a friend o ' Sister  Helen's -- pretty as a dagerr'otype , an ' gentle - like and tender . Laura  lets me carry her skates , an ' I 'm glad of it , although I have my hands  full already with the lantern , the hockies , and the rest . Hiram Peabody  keeps us waitin ' , for he has overslept himself , an ' when he comes  trottin ' out at last the girls make fun of him -- all except Sister Mary ,  an ' she sort o ' sticks up for Hiram , an ' we 're all so ' cute we kind o '  calc'late we know the reason why .  "" And now , "" said Ezra softly , "" the pictur ' changes : seems as if I could  see the pond . The ice is like a black lookin'-glass , and Hiram Peabody  slips up the first thing , an ' down he comes , lickety - split , an ' we all  laugh -- except Sister Mary , an ' _ she _ says it is very imp'lite to laugh  at other folks ' misfortunes . Ough ! how cold it is , and how my fingers  ache with the frost when I take off my mittens to strap on Laura 's  skates ! But , oh , how my cheeks burn ! And how careful I am not to hurt  Laura , an ' how I ask her if that 's ' tight enough , ' an ' how she tells  me ' jist a little tighter ' and how we two keep foolin ' along till the  others hev gone an ' we are left alone ! An ' how quick I get my _ own _  skates strapped on -- none o ' your new - fangled skates with springs an '  plates an ' clamps an ' such , but honest , ol'-fashioned wooden ones with  steel runners that curl up over my toes an ' have a bright brass button  on the end ! How I strap 'em and lash 'em and buckle 'em on ! An ' Laura  waits for me an ' tells me to be sure to get 'em on tight enough -- why ,  bless me ! after I once got 'em strapped on , if them skates he d come  off , the feet wud ha ' come with 'em ! An ' now away we go -- Laura and  me . Around the bend -- near the medder where Si Barker 's dog killed a  woodchuck last"	1	0
"So the hours go , an ' it is sun - up  at last , an ' Sister Helen says we must be gettin ' home . When we take  our skates off , our feet feel as if they were wood . Laura has lost her  tippet ; I lend her mine , and she kind o ' blushes . The old pond seems  glad to have us go , and the fire - hangbird 's nest in the willer tree  waves us good - bye . Laura promises to come over to our house in the  evenin ' , and so we break up .  "" Seems now , "" continued Ezra musingly , "" seems now as if I could see us  all at breakfast . The race on the pond has made us hungry , and Mother  says she never knew anybody else 's boys that had such capac'ties as  hers . It is the Yankee Thanksgivin ' breakfast -- sausages an ' fried  potatoes , an ' buckwheat cakes , an ' syrup -- maple syrup , mind ye , for  Father has his own sugar bush , and there was a big run o ' sap last  season . Mother says , ' Ezry an ' Amos , wo n't you never get through  eatin ' ? We want to clear off the table , fer there 's pies to make , and  nuts to crack , and laws sakes alive ! The turkey 's got to be stuffed  yet ! ' Then how we all fly around ! Mother sends Helen up into the attic  to get a squash while Mary 's makin ' the pie crust . Amos an ' I crack  the walnuts -- they call 'em hickory nuts out in this pesky country of  sagebrush and pasture land . The walnuts are hard , and it 's all we  can do to crack 'em . Ev'ry once'n a while one on 'em slips outer our  fingers and goes dancin ' over the floor or flies into the pan Helen is  squeezin ' pumpkin into through the col'nder . Helen says we 're shif'less  an ' good for nothin' but frivolin ' ; but Mother tells us how to crack  the walnuts so 's not to let 'em fly all over the room , an ' so 's not to  be all jammed to pieces like the walnuts was down at the party at the  Peasleys ' last winter . An ' now here comes Tryphena Foster , with her  gingham gown an ' muslin apron on ; her folks have gone up to Amherst  for Thanksgivin ' , an ' Tryphena has come over to help our folks get  dinner . She thinks a great deal o ' Mother , 'cause"	1	0
" "" An ' now , "" murmured Ezra gently , as a tone of deeper reverence crept  into his voice , "" I can see Father sittin ' all by himself in the  parlour . Father 's hair is very gray , and there are wrinkles on his  honest old face . He is lookin ' through the winder at the Holyoke  hills over yonder , and I can guess he 's thinkin ' of the time when he  wuz a boy like me an ' Amos , an ' uster climb over them hills an ' kill  rattlesnakes an ' hunt partridges . Or does n't his eyes quite reach the  Holyoke hills ? Do they fall kind o ' lovingly but sadly on the little  buryin ' ground jest beyond the village ? Ah , Father knows that spot ,  an ' he loves it , too , for there are treasures there whose memory he  would n't swap for all the world could give . So , while there is a kind  o ' mist in Father 's eyes , I can see he is dreamin'-like of sweet an '  tender things , and a - communin ' with memory -- hearin ' voices I never  heard , an ' feelin ' the tech of hands I never pressed ; an ' seein '  Father 's peaceful face I find it hard to think of a Thanksgivin '  sweeter than Father 's is .  "" The pictur ' in the firelight changes now , "" said Ezra , "" an ' seems as if  I wuz in the old frame meetin'-house . The meetin'-house is on the hill ,  and meetin ' begins at half - pas ' ten . Our pew is well up in front -- seems  as if I could see it now . It has a long red cushion on the seat , and  in the hymn - book rack there is a Bible an ' a couple of Psalmodies . We  walk up the aisle slow , and Mother goes in first ; then comes Mary ,  then me , then Helen , then Amos , and then Father . Father thinks it is  jest as well to have one o ' the girls set in between me an ' Amos . The  meetin'-house is full , for everybody goes to meetin ' Thanksgivin ' Day .  The minister reads the proclamation an ' makes a prayer , an ' then he  gives out a psalm , an ' we all stan ' up an ' turn ' round an ' join the  choir . Sam Merritt has come up from Palmer to spend Thanksgivin ' with  the ol' folks , an ' he is singin ' tenor to - day in his"	1	0
"Laura sings soprano in the choir , and Sam stands next to her an '  holds the book .  "" Seems as if I could hear the minister 's voice , full of earnestness an '  melody , comin ' from way up in his little round pulpit . He is tellin ' us  why we should be thankful , an ' , as he quotes Scriptur ' an ' Dr. Watts ,  we boys wonder how anybody can remember so much of the Bible . Then I  get nervous and worried . Seems to me the minister was never comin ' to  lastly , and I find myself wonderin ' whether Laura is listenin ' to what  the preachin ' is about , or is writin ' notes to Sam Merritt in the back  of the tune book . I get thirsty , too , and I fidget about till Father  looks at me , and Mother nudges Helen , and Helen passes it along to me  with interest .  "" An ' then , "" continues Ezra in his revery , "" when the last hymn is given  out an ' we stan ' up agin an ' join the choir , I am glad to see that  Laura is singin ' outer the book with Miss Hubbard , the alto . An ' goin'  out o ' meetin ' I kind of edge up to Laura and ask her if I kin have the  pleasure of seein ' her home .  "" An ' now we boys all go out on the Common to play ball . The Enfield  boys have come over , and , as all the Hampshire county folks know , they  are tough fellers to beat . Gorham Polly keeps tally , because he has got  the newest jackknife -- oh , how slick it whittles the old broom handle  Gorham picked up in Packard 's store an ' brought along jest to keep  tally on ! It is a great game of ball ; the bats are broad and light ,  and the ball is small and soft .

"We all set  round -- Father , Mother , Aunt Lydia Holbrook , Uncle Jason , Mary , Helen ,  Tryphena Foster , Amos , and me . How big an ' brown the turkey is , and how  good it smells ! There are bounteous dishes of mashed potato , turnip ,  an ' squash , and the celery is very white and cold , the biscuits are  light and hot , and the stewed cranberries are red as Laura 's cheeks .  Amos and I get the drumsticks ; Mary wants the wishbone to put over the  door for Hiram , but Helen gets it . Poor Mary , she always _ did _ have to  give up to ' rushin ' Helen , ' as we call her . The pies -- oh , what pies  Mother makes ; no dyspepsia in 'em , but good nature an ' good health  an ' hospitality !

"Then , aft'r a while , when  Mary and Helen bring in the cookies , nutcakes , cider , an ' apples ,  Mother says : ' I do n't believe we 're goin' to hev enough apples to go  round ; Ezry , I guess I 'll have to get you to go down cellar for some  more . ' Then I says : ' All right , Mother , I 'll go , providin ' some one'll  go along an ' hold the candle . ' An ' when I say this I look right at  Laura , an ' she blushes . Then Helen , jest for meanness , says : ' Ezry , I  s'pose you ai n't willin ' to have your fav'rite sister go down cellar  with you and catch her death o ' cold ? ' But Mary , who hez been showin '  Hiram Peabody the phot'graph album for more'n an hour , comes to the  rescue an ' makes Laura take the candle , and she shows Laura how to hold  it so it wo n't go out .  "" The cellar is warm an ' dark .

" "" It is so like Mother , "" mused Ezra ; "" so like her with her gentleness  an ' clingin ' love . Hers is the sweetest picture of all , and hers the  best love . ""  Dream on , Ezra ; dream of the old home with its dear ones , its holy  influences , and its precious inspiration!--Mother .

CHIP 'S THANKSGIVING      Chip had plenty of nuts on Thanksgiving Day . The little      lady called Heart 's Delight saw to that . Can you guess      who Chip was ?  THEY had got "" way through , "" as Terry said , to the nuts . It had been  a beautiful Thanksgiving dinner "" so far . "" Grandmother 's sweet face  beamed down the length of the great table , over all the little crinkly  grandheads , at grandfather 's face . Everybody felt very thankful .  "" I wish all the children this side o ' the north pole had had some  turkey , too , and squash and cram'bry -- and things , "" said Silence  quietly . Silence was always wishing beautiful things like that .  "" An ' some nuts , "" added Terry , setting his small white teeth into the  meat of a big fat walnut . "" It would n't seem Thanksgivingy ' thout nuts . ""  "" I know somebody who would be thankful with just nuts , "" smiled  grandfather . "" Indeed , I think he 'd rather have them for all the courses  of his Thanksgiving dinner ! ""  "" Just nuts ! No turkey , nor puddin ' , nor anything ? ""  The crinkly grandheads all bobbed up from their plates and nut - pickers  in amazement . Just nuts !  "" Yes . Guess who he is ? "" Grandfather 's laughing eyes twinkled up the  long table at grandmother .  "" I 'll give you three guesses apiece , beginning with Heart 's Delight .  Guess number one , Heart 's Delight . ""  "" Chip , "" gravely . Heart 's Delight had guessed it the very first guess .  "" Chip ! "" laughed all the little grand girls and boys . Why , of course !  Chip ! He would rather have just nuts for Thanksgiving dinner !  "" I wish he had some o ' mine ! "" cried Silence .  "" An ' mine ! "" cried Terry ; and all the others wished he had some of  theirs . What a Thanksgiving"	1	0
"A soft pink colour had come into her round cheeks . Everybody  looked at her inquiringly , for how did Heart 's Delight know Chip had  plenty of nuts ? Then Terry remembered something .  "" Oh , that 's where her nuts went to ! "" he cried . "" Heart 's Delight gave  'em to Chip ! We could n't think what she 'd done with 'em all . ""  The pink colour was growing pinker -- very pink indeed .  "" Yes , that 's where , "" said Silence , leaning over to squeeze one of  Heart 's Delight 's little hands . And sure enough , it was . In the  beautiful nut month of October , when the children went after their  winter 's supply of nuts , little Heart 's Delight had left all her  little rounded heap just where bright - eyed , nut - loving squirrel Chip  would be sure to find them and hurry them away to his winter hole . And  Chip had found them , she was sure , for not one was left when she went  back to see , the next day .  "" Why , maybe this very minute -- right now -- Chip 's cracking his  Thanksgiving dinner ! "" Terry laughed .  "" Same as we are ! Maybe he 's got to the nut cour -- oh , they 're all nut  courses ! But maybe he 's sittin ' up to his table with the rest of the  folks , thanksgiving to Heart 's Delight , "" Silence said .  Heart 's Delight 's little shy face nearly hid itself over her plate .  This was dreadful ! It was necessary to change the subject at once , and  a dear little thought came to her aid .  "" But I 'm afraid he has n't got any gran'father and gran'mother to his  Thanksgiving , "" she said softly . "" I should n't think anybody could  thanksgive ' thout a gran'mother and gran'father . ""  THE MASTER OF THE HARVEST      A good old - fashioned story for the older boys and girls      to read on the Sunday before Thanksgiving Day .  THE Master of the Harvest walked by the side of his cornfields in the  early year , and a cloud was over his face , for there had been no rain  for several weeks , and the earth was hard from the parching of the cold  east winds , and the young wheat had not been able to spring up .  So , as he looked over the long ridges that lay stretched in rows before  him , he was vexed , and began to grumble , and say , "" The harvest would be "	1	0
" And the man 's discontent was whispered all over the field , and all  along the long ridges where the corn seeds lay ; and when it reached  them they murmured out , "" How cruel to complain ! Are we not doing our  best ? Have we let one drop of moisture pass by unused , one moment of  warmth come to us in vain ? Have we not seized on every chance , and  striven every day to be ready for the hour of breaking forth ? Are we  idle ? Are we obstinate ? Are we indifferent ? Shall we not be found  waiting and watching ? How cruel to complain ! ""  Of all this , however , the Master of the Harvest heard nothing , so the  gloom did not pass away from his face . On the contrary , he took it  with him into his comfortable home , and repeated to his wife the dark  words that all things were going wrong ; that the drought would ruin the  harvest , for the corn was not yet sprung .  And still thinking thus , he laid his head on his pillow , and presently  fell asleep .  But his wife sat up for a while by the bedside , and opened her Bible ,  and read , "" The harvest is the end of the world , and the reapers are the  angels . ""  Then she wrote this text in pencil on the flyleaf at the end of the  book , and after it the date of the day , and after the date the words ,  "" Lord , the husbandman , Thou waitest for the precious fruit Thou hast  sown , and hast long patience for it ! Amen , O Lord , Amen ! ""  After which the good woman knelt down to pray , and as she prayed she  wept , for she knew that she was very ill .  But what she prayed that night was heard only in heaven .  And so a few days passed on as before , and the house was gloomy with  the discontent of its master ; but at last one evening the wind  changed , the sky became heavy with clouds , and before midnight there  was rain all over the land ; and when the Master of the Harvest came in  next morning , wet from his early walk by the cornfields , he said it was  well it had come at last , and that , at last , the corn had sprung up .  On which his wife looked at him with a smile , and said , "" How often  things came right , about which one had been anxious and disturbed ."	1	0
"And day by day the Master of the  Harvest saw them and was satisfied ; but because he was satisfied , and  his anxiety was gone , he spoke of other things , and forgot to rejoice .  And a murmur arose among them : "" Should not the Master have welcomed  us to life ? He was angry but lately , because the seed he had sown had  not yet brought forth ; now that it has brought forth , why is he not  glad ? What more does he want ? Have we not done our best ? Are we not  doing it minute by minute , hour by hour , day by day ? From the morning  and evening dews , from the glow of the midday sun , from the juices of  the earth , from the breezes which freshen the air , even from clouds  and rain , are we not taking in food and strength , warmth and life ,  refreshment and joy ; so that one day the valleys may laugh and sing ,  because the good seed hath brought forth abundantly ? Why does he not  rejoice ? ""  As before , however , of all they said the Master of the Harvest heard  nothing ; and it never struck him to think of the young corn blades '  struggling life . Nay , once , when his wife asked him if the wheat was  doing well , he answered , "" Very fairly , "" and nothing more . But she then ,  because the evening was fine and the fairer weather had revived her  failing powers , said she would walk out by the cornfields herself .  And so it came to pass that they went out together . And together they  looked all along the long green ridges of wheat , and watched the blades  as they quivered and glistened in the breeze which sprang up with the  setting sun . Together they walked , together they looked ; looking at the  same things and with the same human eyes ; even as they had walked , and  looked , and lived together for years , but with a world dividing their  hearts ; and what was ever to unite them ?  Even then , as they moved along , she murmured half aloud , half to  herself , thinking of the anxiety that had passed away : "" Thou visitest  the earth , and blessest it ; thou makest it very plenteous . ""  To which he answered , if answer it may be called , "" Why are you always  so gloomy ? Why should Scripture be quoted about such common things ? ""  And she looked in his face and smiled , but did"	1	0
" _ She _ might never see the harvest upon earth again ; for her that other  was at hand , whereof the reapers were to be angels .  And when she opened her Bible that night she wrote on the flyleaf the  text she had quoted to her husband , and after the text the date of the  day , and after the date the words , "" Bless me , even me also , oh , my  Father , that I may bring forth fruit with patience ! ""  Very peaceful were the next few weeks that followed , for all nature  seemed to rejoice in the weather , and the corn blades shot up till they  were nearly two feet high , and about them the Master of the Harvest had  no complaints to make .  But at the end of that time , behold , the earth began to be hard and  dry again , for once more rain was wanted ; and by degrees the growing  plants failed for want of moisture and nourishment , and lost power and  colour , and became weak and yellow in hue . And once more the husbandmen  began to fear and tremble , and once more the brow of the Master of the  Harvest was overclouded with angry apprehension .  And as the man got more and more anxious about the fate of his crops ,  he grew more and more irritable and distrustful , and railed as before ,  only louder now , against the heavens because there was no rain ; against  the earth because it lacked moisture ; against the corn plants because  they had waxed feeble .  Nay , once , when his sick wife reproved him gently , praying him to  remember how his fears had been turned to joy before , he reproached her  in his turn for sitting in the house and pretending to judge of what  she could know nothing about , and bade her come out and see for herself  how all things were working together for ill .  And although he spoke it in bitter jest , and she was very ill , she said  she would go , and went .  So once more they walked out together , and once more looked over the  cornfields ; but when he stretched out his arm and pointed to the long  ridges of blades , and she saw them shrunken and faded in hue , her heart  was grieved within her , and she turned aside and wept over them .  Nevertheless , she said she durst not cease from hope , since an hour  might renew the face of the earth , if God so willed ; neither should she  dare to complain ,"	1	0
" But of all this he knew nothing , and what he thought , as he listened ,  was that she was as weak in mind as in body ; and what he said was that  a man must be an idiot who would not complain when he saw the bread  taken from under his very eyes !  And his murmurings and her tears sent a shudder all along the long  ridges of sickly corn blades , and they asked one of another , "" Why does  he murmur ? and , Why does she weep ? Are we not doing all we can ? Do we  slumber or sleep , and let opportunities pass by unused ? Are we not  watching and waiting against the times of refreshing ? Shall we not  be found ready at last ? Why does he murmur ? and , Why does she weep ?  Is she , too , fading and waiting ? Has she , too , a master who has lost  patience ? ""  Meantime , when she opened her Bible that night , she wrote on the  flyleaf the text , "" Wherefore should a man complain , a man for the  punishment of his sins ? "" and after the text the date of the day , and  after the date the words , "" Thou dost turn Thy face from us , and we are  troubled ; but , Lord , how long , how long ? ""  And by and by came on the long - delayed times of refreshing , but so  slowly and imperfectly that the change in the corn could scarcely  be detected for a while . Nevertheless , it told at last , and stems  struggled up among the blades , and burst forth into flowers , which  gradually ripened into ears of grain . But a struggle it had been , and  continued to be , for the measure of moisture was scant , and the due  amount of warmth in the air was wanting . Nevertheless , by struggling  and effort the young wheat advanced , little by little , in growth ;  preparing itself , minute by minute , hour by hour , day by day , as best  it could , for the great day of the harvest . As best it could ! Would the  Master of the Harvest ask more ? Alas ! he had still something to find  fault with , for when he looked at the ears and saw that they were small  and poor , he grumbled , and said the yield would be less than it ought  to be , and the harvest would be bad .  And as more weeks went on , and the same weather continued , and the"	1	0
"And they shuddered and murmured : "" How cruel to complain ! Had  we been idle , had we been negligent , had we been indifferent , we might  have passed away without bearing fruit at all . How cruel to complain ! ""  But of all this the Master of the Harvest heard nothing , so he did not  cease to complain .  Meantime , another week or two went on , and people as they glanced over  the land wished that a few good rainy days would come and do their work  decidedly , so that the corn ears might fill . And behold , while the wish  was yet on their lips , the sky became charged with clouds , darkness  spread over the country , a wild wind rose , and the growling of thunder  announced a storm . And such a storm ! People hid from it in cellars and  closets and dark corners , as if now , for the first time , they believed  in a God , and were trembling at the new - found fact ; as if they could  never discover Him in His sunshine and blessings , but only thus in His  tempests and wrath .  And all along the long ridges of wheat plants drove the rain - laden  blast , and they bent down before it and rose up again , like the waves  of a labouring sea . Ears over ears they bowed down ; ears above ears  they rose up . They bowed down as if they knew that to resist was  destruction ; they rose up as if they had a hope beyond the storm . Only  here and there , where the whirlwinds were the strongest , they fell down  and could not lift themselves again . So the damage done was but little ,  and the general good was great . But when the Master of the Harvest  saw here and there patches of overweighted corn yet dripping from the  thunder showers , he grew angry for them , and forgot to think of the  long ridges that stretched over his fields , where the corn ears were  swelling and rejoicing .  And he came in gloomy to his home , when his wife was hoping that now ,  at last , all would be well ; and when she looked at him the tumult of  her soul grew beyond control , and she knelt down before him as he sat  moody in his chair , and threw her arms round him , and cried out : "" It is  of the Lord 's mercies that we are not utterly consumed . Oh , husband !  pray for the corn and for me , that it may go well with"	1	0
" And presently came a new distress : for when the days of rain had  accomplished their gracious work , and every one was satisfied , behold ,  they did not cease . And as hitherto the cry had gone up for water on  the furrows , so now men 's hearts failed them for fear lest it should  continue to overflowing , and lest mildew should set in upon the full ,  rich ears , and the glorious crops should be lost .  And the Master of the Harvest walked out by his cornfields , his face  darker than ever . And he railed against the rain because it would not  cease ; against the sun because it would not shine ; against the wheat  because it might perish before the harvest .  "" But why does he always and only complain ? "" moaned the corn plants , as  the new terror was breathed over the field . "" Have we not done our best  from the first ? And has not mercy been with us , sooner or later , all  along ? When moisture was scant , and we throve but little , why did he  not rejoice over that little , and wait , as we did , for more ? Now that  abundance has come , and we swell triumphant in strength and in hope ,  why does he not share our joy in the present , and wait in trust , as  we do , for the future ripening change ? Why does he always complain ?  Has he himself some hard master , who would fain reap where he has not  sown , and gather where he has not strewed , and who has no pity for his  servants who strive ? ""  But of all this the Master of the Harvest heard nothing . And when the  days of rain had rolled into weeks and the weeks into months , and the  autumn set in , and the corn still stood up green in the ridges , as if  it never meant to ripen at all , the boldest and most hopeful became  uneasy , and the Master of the Harvest despaired .  But his wife had risen no more from her bed , where she lay in sickness  and suffering , yet in patient trust , watching the sky through the  window that faced her pillow , looking for the relief that came at last .  For even at the eleventh hour , when hope seemed almost over , and men  had half learned to submit to their expected trial , the dark days began  to be varied by a few hours of sunshine ; and though these passed away ,  and the gloom and rain returned again"	1	0
"And after the date the words , "" Unto whom much is given ,  of him shall much be required ; yet if Thou , Lord , be extreme to mark  iniquity , O Lord , who may stand ? ""  And day by day , the hours of sunshine were more in number , and the  hours of rain and darkness fewer , and by degrees the green corn ears  ripened into yellow , and the yellow turned into gold , and the harvest  was ready , and the labourers not wanting . And the bursting corn broke  out into songs of rejoicing , and cried , "" At least we have not waited  and watched in vain ! Surely goodness and mercy have followed us all the  days of our life , and we are crowned with glory and honour . Where is  the Master of the Harvest , that he may claim his own with joy ? ""  But the Master of the Harvest was bending over the bed of his dying  wife .  And she whispered that her Bible should be brought , and he brought  it , and she said , "" Open it at the flyleaf at the end , and write , ' It  is sown in corruption , it is raised in incorruption ; it is sown in  dishonour , it is raised in glory ; it is sown in weakness , it is raised  in power ; it is sown a natural body , it is raised a spiritual body ! ' ""  And she bade him add the date of the day , and after the date of the  day , the words , "" O Lord , in Thy mercy say of me -- She hath done what she  could ! "" And then she laid her hand in his , and so fell asleep in hope .  And the harvest of the earth was gathered into barns , and the  gathering - day of rejoicing was over , and the Master of it all sat alone  by his fireside , with his wife 's Bible on his knee . And he read the  texts and the dates and the prayers , from the first day when the corn  seeds were held back by drought ; and as he read a new heart seemed to  burst out within him from the old one -- a heart which the Lord of the  other Harvest was making soft , and the springing whereof He would bless .  And henceforth , in his going out and coming in from watching the fruits  of the earth , the texts and the dates and the prayers were ever present  in his mind , often rising to his lips ; and he murmured and complained"	1	0
" And thus -- in one hope of their calling -- the long - divided hearts were  united at last .  A THANKSGIVING DINNER      Ministers ' sons , somehow , have a bad reputation .      Little Johnnie was one and he thought it pretty hard      to have to go to church on Thanksgiving Day . But the      pink - frosted cakes----  "" OH , DEAR ! "" puffed a certain little boy one bright Thanksgiving  morning , as he jerked his chubby neck into the stiffest of white  collars . "" Great fun , is n't it , having to sit up in meeting for a couple  of hours straight as a telegraph pole when I might be playing football  and beating the Haddam team all to hollow ! This is what comes of your  pa 's being the minister , I s'pose . ""  But Johnnie , for that was his name , continued his dressing , the ten  years of his young life having taught him how useless it is to make a  fuss over what has to be done .  In a few minutes he had finished , and was quite satisfied with his  appearance , but for his shoes . These he eyed for a moment , and  concluding that they would not pass inspection , started for the  woodshed to give them a shine .  On his way he passed the open dining - room door , and suddenly halted .  "" Oh ! Why ca n't I have a nice little lunch during sermon time ? ""  He took a step back and peeped slyly into the room ; then stole across  to the old - fashioned cupboard , stealthily opening the doors , and such  an array of good things you never beheld ! Sally was the best cook in  Brockton any day , but on Thanksgiving she could work wonders .  He looked with longing eyes from one dish to another . Now the big pies  were out of the question , and the cranberry tarts -- he felt of them  lovingly -- but no , they were altogether too sticky . He stood on tiptoe  to see what was on the second shelf . To his delight he found a platter  filled with just the daintiest little pink - frosted cakes you ever saw .  "" O - oo , thimble cakes ! "" he exclaimed . "" You are just the fellows I want !  I 'll take you along to church with me . "" He cast one quick glance  around , then grabbed a handful of the tiny cakes and crammed them into  his trousers ' pocket .  "" Lucky for me ma is n't going to meeting to - day , """	1	0
"And  where 's your contribution , boy ? You have n't forgotten that ? ""  "" No , sir , "" meekly answered Johnnie , "" it 's tied up in my handkerchief . ""  But his heart sank -- the front seat ! How ever was his lunch to come in  now ?  The opening hymn had been sung , the prayer of thanksgiving offered , and  now , as the collection was about to be taken , the pastor begged his  people to be especially generous to the poor on this day .  Up in the front pew sat Johnnie , but never a word of the notice did he  hear , so busy was he planning out his own little affair . It was n't such  easy planning either , just supposing he got caught !  But what was that ? Johnnie jumped as if he had been struck . However ,  it was nothing but the money plate under his nose , and the good Deacon  Simms standing calmly by .  To the guilty boy it seemed as if the deacon must have been waiting for  ten minutes at the least , and in a great flurry he began to fumble for  his handkerchief . What _ had _ he done with it ? Oh , there it was at last ,  way down in the depths of his right trousers ' pocket .  He caught hold of the knotted corner , and out came the handkerchief  with a whisk and a flourish , and scatter , rattle , helter - skelter , out  flew a half - dozen pink thimble cakes , down upon the floor , back into  Mrs. Smiley 's pew , and to Johnnie 's horror one pat into the deacon 's  plate !  The good man 's eyes tried not to twinkle as he removed the unusual  offering , and passed on more quickly than was his wo nt .  Miserable Johnnie , with his face as red as a rooster 's comb and eyes  cast down in shame , saw nothing but the green squares on the carpet  and the dreadful pink - frosted cakes . He was sure that every one in the  church was glaring at him ; probably even grandma had forsaken him , and  each moment he dreaded -- he knew not what .  To his surprise , the service seemed to go right on as usual . Another  hymn was sung , and then there was a general settling down for the  sermon . Very soon he began to grow tired of just gazing at the floor ,  yet he dared not look up , and by and by the heavy eyes drooped and  Johnny was fast asleep .  All"	1	0
"She was a courageous little  body indeed , but what mother would not venture a good deal for her  hungry babies ? Such a repast as this was certainly the opportunity of  a lifetime . Looking cautiously around , then concluding that all was  safe , she disappeared down a hole in a corner way under the seat . In a  twinkling she was back again ; this time , however , she was not alone .  Four little ones pattered after Mamma Mouse , and eight bright eyes  spied a dinner worth running for .  Never mind what they did ; but when Johnnie awoke at the strains of the  closing hymn and tried to remember what had gone wrong , he saw nothing  of the pink - frosted cakes save some scattered crumbs .  What could have become of them , he thought , in bewilderment .  He hardly knew how he got out of the church that day , but he found  himself rushing down the road a sadder and a wiser boy . Grandma and  papa had remained to chat . Johnnie did not feel like chatting to - day .  When he reached the house he did not go in , but out to the hayloft ,  his favourite resort in time of trouble . When the dinner bell sounded ,  notwithstanding the delicious Thanksgiving odours which had been wafted  even to the barn , it was an unwelcome summons ; yet go he must , and  walking sheepishly into the dining - room , he slunk into his chair .  "" Well , John , "" said his father , as he helped him to turkey , "" I  understand that you did not forget the poor to - day . Eh , my son ? ""  "" The poor ? "" What could he mean ? Johnnie was too puzzled to speak .  Then his father went on to tell how little Mrs. Mouse and her babies  had nibbled a wondrous dinner of pink thimble cakes on the floor of pew  number one while Johnnie slept . Grandma and Mrs. Smiley had told him  all about it on the way home ; besides , he had seen enough himself from  the pulpit .  Johnny bravely bore the laugh at his expense , and as the merriment died  away heaved a deep sigh of relief , and exclaimed , "" Well , I 'm glad  somebody had a feast , even if it was n't the fellow ' twas meant for !  Humph , _ ' twas _ quite a setup for poor church mice , was n't it ? But they  need n't be looking for another next year . You do n't catch me trying  that again -- no"	1	0
" "" DAY after to - morrow will be Thanksgiving , "" said Walter , taking his  seat beside Grandpa Davis on the top step of the front gallery .  "" And no turkey for dinner , neither , "" retorted Grandma Davis , while her  bright steel needles clicked in and out of the sock she was knitting .  The old man was smoking his evening pipe , and sat for a moment with his  eyes fixed meditatively upon the blue hills massed in the distance .  "" Have we got so pore as all that , Mother ? "" he asked , after a while ,  glancing over his shoulder at his wife , who was rocking to and fro just  back of him .  "" I 'm obleeged to own to the truth , "" answered the old lady dejectedly .  "" What with the wild varmints in the woods and one thing an ' another ,  I 'm about cleaned out of all the poultry I ever had . It 's downright  disheartenin ' . ""  "" Well , then , "" asserted Grandpa Davis , with an unmirthful chuckle , "" it  do n't appear to me as we 've got so powerful much to be thankful about  this year . ""  "" Why , Grandpa ! "" cried Walter , in shocked surprise , "" I never did hear  you talk like that before . ""  "" Never had so much call to do it , mebbe , "" interposed the old man  cynically .  The last rays of the setting sun touched the two silvered heads , and  rested there like a benediction , before disappearing below the horizon .  Silence had fallen upon the little group , and a bullfrog down in the  fishpond was croaking dismally .  "" Why do n't you go hunting , and try to kill you a turkey for  Thanksgiving ? "" ventured Walter , slipping his arm insinuatingly through  his grandfather 's . "" I saw a great big flock of wild ones down on the  branch last week , and I got right close up to them before they flew . ""  "" I reckon there ought to be a smart sight of game round and about them  cane brakes along that branch , "" said the old man slowly , as though  thinking aloud . "" It used to be ahead of any strip of woods in all these  parts , when me and Dick was boys . But nobody ai n't hunted there , to my  knowledge , not sence me and him fell out . ""  "" I wish you and Grandpa Dun were friends , "" sighed Walter . "" It does  seem too bad to have"	1	0
"   That 's just exactly what Grandpa Dun says about you , "" Walter assured  him very earnestly .  "" Would n't wonder if he did , "" said the old man pointedly . "" Dick is  always ben a mighty hand to talk , and he 'd drap dead in his tracks if  he could n't get in the last word . ""  Be this as it might , the breach had begun when the Davis cattle broke  down the worm fence and demolished the Dun crop of corn , and it  widened when the Dun hogs found their way through an old water gap and  rooted up a field of the Davis sweet potatoes . Several times similar  depredations were repeated , and then shotguns were used on both sides  with telling effect . The climax was reached when John Dun eloped with  Rebecca , the only child of the Davises .  The young couple were forbidden their respective homes , though the farm  they rented was scarce half a mile away , and the weeks rolled into  months without sign of their parents relenting .  When Walter was born , however , the two grandmothers stole over , without  their husbands ' knowledge , and mingled their tears in happy communion  over the tiny blue - eyed mite .  It was a memorable day at each of the houses when the sturdy little  fellow made his way , unbidden and unattended , to pay his first call ,  and ever afterward ( though they would not admit it , even to themselves )  the grandfathers watched for his coming , and vied with each other in  trying to win the highest place in his young affections .  He had inherited characteristics of each of his grandsires , and  possessed the bold , masterful manner which was common to them both .  "" Say , Grandpa , "" he urged , "" go hunting to - morrow and try to kill a  turkey for Thanksgiving , wo n't you ? I know grandma would feel better to  have one , and if you make a cane caller , like papa does , I 'll bet you  can get a shot at one sure . ""  The old man did not commit himself about going , but when Walter saw  him surreptitiously take down his gun from the pegs on the wall across  which it had lain for so many years , and begin to rub the barrels and  oil the hammers , he went home satisfied that he had scored another  victory .  Perhaps nothing less than his grandson 's pleading could have induced  Grandpa Davis to visit again the old hunting - ground which had been so  dear to"	1	0
" The first cold streaks of dawn were just stealing into the sky the  next morning when , accoutred with shot - pouch , powder - flask , and his  old double - barrelled gun , Grandpa Davis made his way toward the  branch . A medley of bird notes filled the air , long streamers of gray  moss floated out from the swaying trees , and showers of autumn leaves  fluttered down to earth . Some of the cows were grazing outside the pen ,  up to their hocks in lush , fresh grass , while others lay on the ground  contentedly chewing their cuds . All of them raised their heads and  looked at him as he passed them by .  How like old times it was to be up at daybreak for a hunt ! The long  years seemed suddenly to have rolled away , leaving him once more a boy .  He almost wondered why Dick had not whistled to him as he used to do .  Dick was an early riser , and somehow always got ready before he did .  There was an alertness in the old man 's face and a spring in his step  as he lived over in thought the joyous days of his childhood . The  clouds were flushed with pink when he came in sight of the big water  oak on the margin of the stream , and recollected how he and Dick had  loved to go swimming in the deep , clear water beneath its shade .  "" We used to run every step of the way , "" he soliloquized , laughing ,  "" unbuttonin ' as we went , chuck our clothes on the bank , and ' most break  our necks tryin ' to git in the water fust . I 've got half a notion to  take a dip this mornin ' , if it was n't quite so cool , "" he went on , but  a timely twinge of rheumatism brought him to his senses , and he seated  himself on the roots of a convenient tree .  Cocking his gun , he laid it across his knees , and waited there  motionless , imitating the yelp of a turkey the while . Three or four  small canes , graduated in size , and fitted firmly one into the other ,  enabled him to make the note , and so expert had he become by long  practice that the deception was perfect .  After a pause he repeated the call ; then came another pause , another  call , and over in the distance there sounded an answer . How the blood  coursed through the old man 's veins as he listened ! There it was again .  It was"	1	0
"This time , to his surprise , an answer  came from a different direction -- a long , rasping sound , a sort of cross  between a cock 's crow and a turkey 's yelp .  He started involuntarily , and very cautiously peeped around . Hardly  twenty steps from him another gray head protruded itself from the bole  of another tree , and Grandpa Davis and Grandpa Dun looked into each  other 's eyes .  "" I 'll be double - jumped - up if that ai n't Dick ! "" cried Grandpa Davis ,  under his breath . "" And there ai n't a turkey as ever wore a feather  that he could fool . A minute more , and he 'll spile the fun . Dick , "" he  commanded , "" stop that racket , and sneak over here by me , "" beckoning  mysteriously . "" Sh - h - h ! they are answerin ' ag'in . Down on your  marrow - bones whilst I call . ""  Flattening himself upon the ground as nearly as he could , and creeping  behind the undergrowth , Grandpa Dun made his way laboriously to the  desired spot . He had never excelled in calling turkeys , but he was a  far better shot than Grandpa Davis .  Without demur the two old boys fell naturally into the _ r√¥le _ of former  days . Breathless and excited , they crouched there , waiting for the  fateful moment . Their nerves were tense , their eyes dilated , and their  hearts beating like trip - hammers .  Grandpa Davis had continued to call , and now the answer was very near .  "" Gimme the first shot , Billy , "" whispered Grandpa Dun . "" I let you do the  callin ' ; and , besides , you know you never could hit nothin' that was n't  as big as the side of a meetin'-house . ""  Before Grandpa Davis had time to reply , there came the "" put - put - put ""  which signals possible danger . A stately gobbler raised his head to  reconnoitre ; two guns were fired almost simultaneously , and , with a  whir and a flutter , the flock disappeared in the cane brake .  The two old boys bounded over the intervening sticks and stumps with  an agility that Walter himself might have envied , and bending over the  prostrate gobbler exclaimed in concert : "" Ai n't he a dandy , though ! ""  They examined him critically , cutting out his beard as a trophy , and  measured the spread of his wings .  "" But he 's yourn , after all , Dick , "" said Grandpa Davis ruefully ."	1	0
"He 's big enough  for us to go halvers and both have plenty . More'n that , you done the  callin ' anyhow . ""  Then they laughed , and as they looked into one another 's faces , each  seemed to realize for the first time that his quondam chum was an old  man .  A moment before they had been two rollicking boys off on a lark  together -- playing hooky , perhaps -- and in the twinkling of an eye some  wicked fairy had waved her wand and metamorphosed them into Walter 's  two grandfathers , who had not spoken to each other since years before  the lad was born .  Yet the humour of the situation was irresistible after all , and ,  without knowing just how it happened , or which made the first advance ,  Dick and Billy found themselves still laughing until the tears coursed  down their furrowed cheeks , and shaking hands with as much vigour as  though each one had been working a pump handle .  "" I 'll tell you what it is , Billy , "" said Dick at last ; "" you all come  over to my house , and we 'll eat him together on Thanksgivin ' . ""  "" See here , Dick , "" suggested Billy , abstracting a nickel from his  trousers ' pocket ; "" heads at your house , and tails at mine . ""  "" All right , "" came the hearty response .  Billy tossed the coin into the air : it struck a twig and hid itself  among the fallen leaves , where they sought it in vain .  "" ' Tain't settled yet , "" announced Dick ; "" but lemme tell you what let 's  do . S'posin ' we all go over to - morrow -- it'll be Thanksgivin ' , you  know -- and eat him at John 's house . ""  "" Good ! "" cried Billy , with beaming face . "" You always did have a head  for thinkin ' up things , Dick , and this here'll sorter split the  difference , and ease matters so as---- ""  "" Yes , and our two old women can draw straws , if they 've got a mind to ,  and see which of them is obligated to make the fust call , "" interrupted  Dick .  "" Jist heft him , old feller , "" urged one of them .  "" Ai n't he a whopper , though ! "" exclaimed the other .  "" Have a chaw , Dick ? "" asked Billy , offering his plug of tobacco .  "" Do n't keer if I do , "" acquiesced Dick , biting off a goodly"	1	0
" "" Dick , do your ricolleck the fight you and a coon had out on the limb  of that tree over yonder , one night ? "" queried Billy , nudging his  companion in the ribs . "" He come mighty nigh gittin ' the best of you . ""  "" He tore one sleeve out of my jacket , and mammy gimme a beatin '  besides , "" giggled Dick . "" And say , Billy , was n't it fun the day we  killed old man Lee 's puddle ducks for wild ones ? I do n't believe I ever  run as fast in my life . ""  "" And , Dick , do you remember the night your pappy hung the saddle up  on the head of the bed to keep you from ridin ' the old gray mare to  singin ' school , and you rid her , bareback , anyway ? You ricolleck you  was stoopin ' over , blowin ' the fire , next mornin ' , when he seen the  hairs on your britches , an ' come down on you with the leather strop  afore you knowed it . ""  Thus one adventure recalled another , and the two old boys laughed  uproariously , clapping their hands and holding their sides , while the  sun climbed up among the treetops .  "" Ai n't we ben two old fools to stay mad all this time ? "" asked one of  them , and the other readily agreed that they had , as they once more  grasped hands before parting .  Walter had arranged the Thanksgiving surprise for his parents , but  when he brought home the big gobbler he was unable longer to keep the  secret , and divulged his share in what had happened .  "" I did n't really believe either one of them could hit a turkey , "" he  confided to his father , "" but I wanted to have them meet once more , for  I knew if they did they would make friends . ""  The parlour was odorous with late fall roses next morning , the table  set , and Walter and his parents in gala attire , when two couples ,  walking arm in arm , appeared upon the stretch of white road leading up  to the front gate .  One couple was slightly in advance of the other , and Grandpa Davis , who  was behind , whispered to his wife :  "" Listen , Mary , Dick is actually tryin ' to sing , and he never could turn  a tune , but somehow it does warm up my heart to hear him : seems like  old times ag'in . ""  After dinner was over -- and"	1	0
"For boys or girls .  THERE is one sound that I shall always remember . It is "" Honk ! ""  I spun around like a top , one summer day when I heard it , looking  nervously in every direction .  I had just come down from the city to the Cape with my sister Hester  for my third summer vacation . I had left the cars with my arms full of  bundles , and hurried toward Aunt Targood 's .  The cottage stood in from the road . There was a long meadow in front of  it . In the meadow were two great oaks and some clusters of lilacs . An  old , mossy stone wall protected the grounds from the road , and a long  walk ran from the old wooden gate to the door .  It was a sunny day , and my heart was light . The orioles were flaming in  the old orchards ; the bobolinks were tossing themselves about in the  long meadows of timothy , daisies , and patches of clover . There was a  scent of new - mown hay in the air .  In the distance lay the bay , calm and resplendent , with white sails and  specks of boats . Beyond it rose Martha 's Vineyard , green and cool and  bowery , and at its wharf lay a steamer .  I was , as I said , light - hearted . I was thinking of rides over the sandy  roads at the close of the long , bright days ; of excursions on the bay ;  of clambakes and picnics .  I was hungry , and before me rose visions of Aunt Targood 's fish  dinners , roast chickens , and berry pies . I was thirsty , but ahead was  the old well sweep , and behind the cool lattice of the dairy window  were pans of milk in abundance .  I tripped on toward the door with light feet , lugging my bundles , and  beaded with perspiration , but unmindful of all discomforts in the  thought of the bright days and good things in store for me .  "" Honk ! honk ! ""  My heart gave a bound !  _ Where _ did that sound come from ?  Out of a cool cluster of innocent - looking lilac bushes I saw a dark  object cautiously moving . It seemed to have no head . I knew , however ,  that it had a head . I had seen it ; it had seized me once in the  previous summer , and I had been in terror of it during all the rest of  the season .  I looked down into the irregular grass , and saw"	1	0
" I dropped my bundles .  In a few flying leaps I returned to the road again , and armed myself  with a stick from a pile of cordwood .  "" Honk ! honk ! honk ! ""  It was a call of triumph . The head was high in the air now . My enemy  moved grandly forward , as became the monarch of the great meadow  farmyard .  I stood with beating heart , after my retreat .  It was Aunt Targood 's gander .  How he enjoyed his triumph , and how small and cowardly he made me feel !  "" Honk ! honk ! honk ! ""  The geese came out of the lilac bushes , bowing their heads to him in  admiration . Then came the goslings -- a long procession of awkward ,  half - feathered things ; they appeared equally delighted .  The gander seemed to be telling his admiring audience all about it :  how a strange lad with many bundles had attempted to cross the yard ;  how he had driven him back , and had captured his bundles , and now was  monarch of the field . He clapped his wings when he had finished his  heroic story , and sent forth such a "" Honk ! "" as might have startled a  major - general .  Then he , with an air of great dignity and coolness , began to examine my  baggage .  Among my effects were several pounds of chocolate caramels done up in  brown paper . Aunt Targood liked caramels , and I brought her a large  supply .  He tore off the wrappers quickly . He bit one . It was good . He began to  distribute the bonbons among the geese , and they , with much liberality  and good - will , among the goslings .  This was too much . I ventured through the gate , swinging my cordwood  stick .  "" Shoo ! ""  He dropped his head on the ground , and drove it down the walk in a  lively waddle toward me .  "" Shoo ! ""  It was Aunt Targood 's voice at the door .  He stopped immediately .  His head was in the air again .  "" Shoo ! ""  Out came Aunt Targood with her broom .  She always corrected the gander with her broom . If I were to be whipped  I should choose a broom -- not the stick .  As soon as he beheld the broom he retired , although with much offended  pride and dignity , to the lilac bushes ; and the geese and goslings  followed him .  "" Hester , you dear child , """	1	0
"I had forgotten all about the gander . ""  We gathered up the bundles and the caramels . I was light - hearted again .  How cool was the sitting - room , with the woodbine falling about the open  window !  Aunt brought me a pitcher of milk , and some strawberries , some bread  and honey , and a fan .  While I was resting and taking my lunch , I could hear the gander  discussing the affairs of the farmyard with the geese . I did not  greatly enjoy the discussion . His tone of voice was very proud , and he  did not seem to be speaking well of me .  I was suspicious that he did not think me a very brave lad . A young  person likes to be spoken well of , even by the gander .  Aunt Targood 's gander had been the terror of many well - meaning people ,  and of some evildoers , for many years . I have seen tramps and pack  peddlers enter the gate , and start on toward the door , when there would  sound that ringing warning like a war blast , "" Honk , honk ! "" and in a  few minutes these unwelcome people would be gone . Farmhouse boarders  from the city would sometimes enter the yard , thinking to draw water by  the old well sweep ; in a few minutes it was customary to hear shrieks ,  and to see women and children flying over the walls , followed by  air - rending "" Honks ! "" and jubilant cackles from the victorious gander  and his admiring family .  Aunt Targood sometimes took summer boarders . Among those that I  remember was the Rev. Mr. Bonney , a fervent - souled Methodist preacher .  He put the gander to flight with the cart whip , on the second day  after his arrival , and seemingly to aunt 's great grief ; but he never  was troubled by the feathered tyrant again .  Young couples sometimes came to Father Bonney to be married ; and one  summer afternoon there rode up to the gate a very young couple , whom  we afterward learned had "" run away , "" or rather , had attempted to get  married without their parents ' approval . The young bridegroom hitched  the horse , and helped from the carriage the gayly dressed miss he  expected to make his wife . They started up the walk upon the run , as  though they expected to be followed and haste was necessary to prevent  the failure of their plans .  "" Honk ! ""  They stopped . It was a voice of authority .  "" Just look at him"	1	0
"On came the gander , with his head and neck upon  the ground . He seized the lad by the calf of his leg , and made an  immediate application of his wings . The latter seemed to think he had  been attacked by dragons . As soon as he could shake him off he ran . So  did the bride , but in another direction ; and while the two were thus  perplexed and discomfited , the bride 's father appeared in a carriage ,  and gave her a most forcible invitation to ride home with him . She  accepted it without discussion . What became of the bridegroom , or how  the matter ended , we never knew .  "" Aunt , what makes you keep that gander year after year ? "" said I one  evening , as we were sitting on the lawn before the door . "" Is it because  he is a kind of watchdog , and keeps troublesome people away ? ""  "" No , child , no ; I do not wish to keep most people away -- not  well - behaved people -- nor to distress nor annoy any one . The fact is ,  there is a story about that gander that I do not like to speak of to  every one -- something that makes me feel tender toward him ; so that if  he needs a whipping I would rather do it . He knows something that no  one else knows . I could not have him killed or sent away . You have  heard me speak of Nathaniel , my oldest boy ? ""  "" Yes . ""  "" That is his picture in my room , you know . He was a good boy to me . He  loved his mother . I loved Nathaniel -- you can not think how much I loved  Nathaniel . It was on my account that he went away .  "" The farm did not produce enough for us all -- Nathaniel , John , and me .  We worked hard , and had a hard time . One year -- that was ten years  ago -- we were sued for our taxes .  "" ' Nathaniel , ' said I , ' I will go to taking boarders . '  "" Then he looked up to me and said -- oh , how noble and handsome he  appeared to me :  "" ' Mother , I will go to sea . '  "" ' Where ? ' asked I , in surprise .  "" ' In a coaster . '  "" I turned white . How I felt !  "" ' You and John can manage the place , ' he continued . ' One of"	1	0
" "" The spring before Skipper Ben -- you have met Skipper Ben -- had given me  some goose eggs ; he had brought them from Canada , and said that they  were wild goose eggs .  "" I set them under hens . In four weeks I had three goslings . I took  them into the house at first , but afterward made a pen for them out in  the yard . I brought them up myself , and one of those goslings is that  gander .  "" Skipper Ben came over to see me the day before Nathaniel was to sail .  Aaron came with him .  "" I said to Aaron :  "" ' What can I give Nathaniel to carry to sea with him to make him think  of home ? Cake , preserves , apples ? I have n't got much ; I have done all I  can for him , poor boy . '  "" Brother looked at me curiously , and said :  "" ' Give him one of those wild geese , and we will fatten it on shipboard  and will have it for our Thanksgiving dinner . '  "" What Brother Aaron said pleased me . The young gander was a noble bird ,  the handsomest of the lot ; and I resolved to keep the geese to kill for  my own use , and to give _ him _ to Nathaniel .  "" The next morning -- it was late in September -- I took leave of Nathaniel .  I tried to be calm and cheerful and hopeful . I watched him as he went  down the walk with the gander struggling under his arms . A stranger  would have laughed , but I did not feel like laughing ; it was true that  the boys who went coasting were usually gone but a few months , and  came home hardy and happy . But when poverty compels a mother and son  to part , after they have been true to each other , and shared their  feelings in common , it seems hard , it seems hard -- though I do not like  to murmur or complain at anything allotted to me .  "" I saw him go over the hill . On the top he stopped and held up the  gander . He disappeared ; yes , my own Nathaniel disappeared . I think of  him now as one who disappeared .  "" November came .

"The  nights were frosty , bright , and calm .  "" I could sleep on those calm nights .  "" One morning I thought I heard a strange sound in the woodland pasture .  It was like a wild goose . I listened ; it was repeated . I was lying in  bed . I started up -- I thought I had been dreaming .  "" On the night before Thanksgiving I went to bed early , being very  tired . The moon was full ; the air was calm and still . I was thinking  of Nathaniel , and I wondered if he would indeed have the gander for  his Thanksgiving dinner , if it would be cooked as well as I would have  cooked it , and if he would think of me that day .  "" I was just going to sleep when suddenly I heard a sound that made me  start up and hold my breath .  "" ' _ Honk ! _ '  "" I thought it was a dream followed by a nervous shock .  "" ' _ Honk ! honk ! _ '  "" There it was again , in the yard , I was surely awake and in my senses .  "" I heard the geese cackle .  "" ' _ Honk ! honk ! honk ! _ '  "" I got out of bed and lifted the curtain . It was almost as light as day .  "" Instead of two geese there were three . Had one of the neighbours '  geese stolen away ?  "" I should have thought so , and should not have felt disturbed , but  for the reason that none of the neighbours ' geese had that peculiar  call -- that hornlike tone that I had noticed in mine .  "" I went out of the door .  "" The _ third _ goose looked like the very gander I had given Nathaniel .  Could it be ?  "" I did not sleep . I rose early and went to the crib for some corn .  "" It _ was _ a gander -- a ' wild gander'--that had come in the night . He  seemed to know me .  "" I trembled all over as though I had seen a ghost . I was so faint that  I sat down on the meal chest .  "" As I was in that place , a bill pecked against the door . The door  opened . The strange gander came hobbling over the crib stone and went  to the corn bin . He stopped there , looked at me , and gave a sort of  glad ' Honk ' as though he knew me and was glad to see me"	1	0
" "" It overcame me . It was Thanksgiving . The church bell would soon be  ringing as on Sunday . And here was Nathaniel 's Thanksgiving dinner and  Brother Aaron's -- had it flown away ? Where was the vessel ?  "" Years have passed -- ten . You know I waited and waited for my boy to  come back . December grew dark with its rainy seas ; the snows fell ; May  righted up the hills , but the vessel never came back . Nathaniel -- my  Nathaniel -- never returned .

This is the real Indian fairy tale of the birth of      Mon - daw - min . Readers of Longfellow will remember his      treatment of the same subject in "" Hiawatha . ""  IN times past , a poor Indian was living with his wife and children in  a beautiful part of the country . He was not only poor , but inexpert  in procuring food for his family , and his children were all too young  to give him assistance . Although poor , he was a man of a kind and  contented disposition . He was always thankful to the Great Spirit for  everything he received . The same disposition was inherited by his  eldest son , who had now arrived at the proper age to undertake the  ceremony of the Ke - ig - uish - im - o - win , or fast , to see what kind of a  spirit would be his guide and guardian through life . Wunzh , for this  was his name , had been an obedient boy from his infancy , and was of a  pensive , thoughtful , and mild disposition , so that he was beloved by  the whole family . As soon as the first indications of spring appeared ,  they built him the customary little lodge at a retired spot , some  distance from their own , where he would not be disturbed during this  solemn rite . In the meantime he prepared himself , and immediately went  into it , and commenced his fast . The first few days he amused himself ,  in the mornings , by walking in the woods and over the mountains ,  examining the early plants and"	1	0
"He recalled  these thoughts to mind after he became too languid to walk about , and  had confined himself strictly to the lodge ; he wished he could dream of  something that would prove a benefit to his father and family , and to  all others . "" True ! "" he thought , "" the Great Spirit made all things , and  it is to him that we owe our lives . But could he not make it easier for  us to get our food than by hunting animals and taking fish ? I must try  to find out this in my visions . ""  On the third day he became weak and faint , and kept his bed . He  fancied , while thus lying , that he saw a handsome young man coming down  from the sky and advancing toward him . He was richly and gayly dressed ,  having on a great many garments of green and yellow colours , but  differing in their deeper or lighter shades . He had a plume of waving  feathers on his head , and all his motions were graceful .  "" I am sent to you , my friend , "" said the celestial visitor , "" by that  Great Spirit who made all things in the sky and on the earth . He has  seen and knows your motives in fasting . He sees that it is from a  kind and benevolent wish to do good to your people , and to procure a  benefit for them , and that you do not seek for strength in war or the  praise of warriors . I am sent to instruct you , and show you how you  can do your kindred good . "" He then told the young man to arise , and  prepare to wrestle with him , as it was only by this means that he could  hope to succeed in his wishes . Wunzh knew he was weak from fasting ,  but he felt his courage rising in his heart , and immediately got up ,  determined to die rather than fail . He commenced the trial , and after  a protracted effort was almost exhausted when the beautiful stranger  said , "" My friend , it is enough for once ; I will come again to try you "" ;  and , smiling on him , he ascended in the air in the same direction  from which he came . The next day the celestial visitor reappeared at  the same hour and renewed the trial . Wunzh felt that his strength was  even less than the day before , but the courage of his mind seemed to  increase in proportion as his body became weaker . Seeing this , the  stranger again"	1	0
" On the  third day he again appeared at the same time and renewed the struggle .  The poor youth was very faint in body , but grew stronger in mind at  every contest , and was determined to prevail or perish in the attempt .  He exerted his utmost powers , and after the contest had been continued  the usual time , the stranger ceased his efforts and declared himself  conquered . For the first time he entered the lodge , and sitting down  beside the youth , he began to deliver his instructions to him , telling  him in what manner he should proceed to take advantage of his victory .   You have won your desires of the Great Spirit , "" said the stranger .  "" You have wrestled manfully . To - morrow will be the seventh day of your  fasting , your father will give you food to strengthen you , and as it  is the last day of trial , you will prevail . I know this , and now tell  you what you must do to benefit your family and your tribe . To - morrow , ""  he repeated , "" I shall meet you and wrestle with you for the last time ;  and , as soon as you have prevailed against me , you will strip off my  garments and throw me down , clean the earth of roots and weeds , make it  soft , and bury me in the spot . When you have done this , leave my body  in the earth , and do not disturb it , but come occasionally to visit the  place , to see whether I have come to life , and be careful never to let  the grass or weeds grow on my grave . Once a month cover me with fresh  earth . If you follow my instructions , you will accomplish your object  of doing good to your fellow - creatures by teaching them the knowledge I  now teach you .

If the Great Spirit will  favour you , he will do it now . It is seven days since you have tasted  food , and you must not sacrifice your life . The Master of Life does not  require that . "" "" My father , "" replied the youth , "" wait till the sun goes  down . I have a particular reason for extending my fast to that hour . ""  "" Very well , "" said the old man . "" I shall wait till the hour arrives"	1	0
"Although the youth had not availed himself of  his father 's offer of food , he felt that new strength had been given  to him , and that exertion had renewed his strength and fortified his  courage . He grasped his angelic antagonist with supernatural strength ,  threw him down , took from him his beautiful garments and plume , and  finding him dead , immediately buried him on the spot , taking all the  precautions he had been told of , and being very confident , at the same  time , that his friend would again come to life . He then returned to  his father 's lodge , and partook sparingly of the meal that had been  prepared for him . But he never for a moment forgot the grave of his  friend . He carefully visited it throughout the spring , and weeded out  the grass , and kept the ground in a soft and pliant state . Very soon  he saw the tops of the green plumes coming through the ground ; and the  more careful he was to obey his instructions in keeping the ground  in order , the faster they grew . He was , however , careful to conceal  the exploit from his father . Days and weeks had passed in this way .  The summer was now drawing toward a close , when one day , after a long  absence in hunting , Wunzh invited his father to follow him to the quiet  and lonesome spot of his former fast . The lodge had been removed , and  the weeds kept from growing on the circle where it stood , but in its  place stood a tall and graceful plant , with bright coloured silken  hair , surmounted with nodding plumes and stately leaves , and golden  clusters on each side . "" It is my friend , "" shouted the lad ; "" it is the  friend of all mankind . It is _ Mondawmin _ . We need no longer rely on  hunting alone ; for , as long as this gift is cherished and taken care  of , the ground itself will give us a living . "" He then pulled an ear .  "" See , my father , "" said he , "" this is what I fasted for . The Great Spirit  has listened to my voice , and sent us something new , and henceforth our  people will not alone depend upon the chase or upon the waters . ""  He then communicated to his father the instructions given him by the  stranger . He told him that the broad husks must be torn away , as he  had pulled off the garments in his wrestling ; and having done this ,  directed"	1	0
"So corn came into the  world .  A MYSTERY IN THE KITCHEN      The boy who has a sister and the girl who has a brother      are the ones who will best like this story of the      spirited twins , Jessie and Jack . Jessie wanted to take      music lessons and Jack tried mining in Colorado .  SOMETHING very mysterious was going on in the Jarvis kitchen . The table  was covered with all sorts of good things -- eggs and butter and raisins  and citron and spices ; and Jessie , with her sleeves rolled up and a  white apron on , was bustling about , measuring and weighing and chopping  and beating and mixing those various ingredients in a most bewildering  way .  Moreover , though she was evidently working for dear life , her face  was full of smiles ; in fact , she seemed to have trouble to keep from  laughing outright , while Betty , the cook , who was washing potatoes at  the sink , fairly giggled with glee every few minutes , as if the sight  of Miss Jessie working in the kitchen was the drollest thing in the  world .  It was one of the pleasantest sights that big , sunny kitchen had seen  for many a day , and the only thing that appeared mysterious about it  was that the two workers acted strangely like conspirators . If they  laughed -- as they did on the slightest provocation -- it was very soft and  at once smothered . Jessie went often to the door leading into the hall ,  and listened ; and if there came a knock on the floor , she snatched off  her apron , hastily wiped her hands , rolled down her sleeves , asked  Betty if there was any flour on her , and then hurried away into another  part of the house , trying to look cool and quiet , as if she had not  been doing anything .  On returning from one of these excursions , as she rolled up her sleeves  again , she said :  "" Betty , we must open the other window if it is cold . Mamma thought she  smelled roast turkey ! ""  Betty burst into a laugh which she smothered in her apron . Jessie  covered her mouth and laughed , too , but the window was opened to  make a draught and carry out the delicious odours , which , it must be  confessed , did fill that kitchen so full that no wonder they crept  through the cracks , and the keyholes , and hung about Jessie 's dress as  she went through the hall , in a way to make one 's mouth water .  """	1	0
" Was n't it lucky we had potpie to - day ?  I do n't know what I should have said if we had n't .   Well , it was not long after that when Jessie lined a baking - dish with  nice - looking crust , filled it with tempting looking chicken legs  and wings and breasts and backs and a bowlful of broth , laid a white  blanket of crust over all , tucked it in snugly around the edge , cut  some holes in the top , and shoved it into the oven just after Betty  drew out a dripping pan in which reposed , in all the glory of rich  brown skin , a beautiful turkey . Mrs. Jarvis could n't have had any nose  at all if she did n't smell that . It filled the kitchen full of nice  smells , and Betty hurried it into the pantry , where the window was open  to cool .  Then Jessie returned to the spices and fruits she had been working over  so long , and a few minutes later she poured a rich , dark mass into a  tin pudding - dish , tied the cover on tight , and slipped it into a large  kettle of boiling water on the stove .  "" There ! "" she said , "" I hope that 'll be good . ""  "" I know it will , "" said Betty confidently . "" That 's y'r ma 's best  receipt . ""  "" Yes , but I never made it before , "" said Jessie doubtfully .  "" Oh , I know it 'll be all right , ' n ' I 'll watch it close , "" said Betty ;  "" ' n ' now you go'n sit with y'r ma . I want that table to git dinner . ""  "" But I 'm going to wash all these things , "" said Jessie .  "" You go long ! I 'd ruther do that myself . ' Twon't take me no time , "" said  Betty .  Jessie hesitated . "" But you have enough to do , Betty . ""  "" I tell you I want to do it , "" the girl insisted .  "" Oh , I know ! "" said Jessie ; "" you like to help about it . Well , you may ;  and I 'm much obliged to you , besides . "" And after a last look at the  fine turkey cooling his heels ( if he had any ) in the pantry , Jessie  went into the other part of the house .  When dinner time arrived and papa came from town , there duly appeared  on the table the potpie before"	1	0
" It was certainly odd , and stranger things happened that night . In the  first place , Jessie sat up in her room and wrote a letter ; and then ,  after her mother was in bed and everything still , she stole down the  back stairs with a candle , quietly , as though she was doing some  mischief . Betty , who came down to help her , brought a box in from the  woodshed ; and the two plotters , very silently , with many listenings at  the door to see if any one was stirring , packed that box full of good  things .  In it the turkey , wrapped in a snowy napkin , found a bed , the chicken  pie and the plum pudding -- beautiful looking as Betty said it would  be -- bore him company ; and numerous small things , jam jars , fruits ,  etc . , etc . , filled the box to its very top . Then the cover , provided  with screws so that no hammering need be done , was fastened on .  "" Now you go to bed , Miss Jessie , "" whispered Betty . "" I 'll wait . ""  "" No , you must be tired , "" said Jessie . "" I 'd just as lief . ""  "" But I 'd ruther , "" said Betty shortly--""'n ' I 'm going to ; it wo n't be  long now . ""  So Jessie crept quietly upstairs , and before long there was a low rap  on the kitchen door . Betty opened it , and there stood a man .  "" Ready ? "" said he .  "" Yes , "" answered Betty ; "" but do n't speak loud ; Miss Jarvis has sharp  ears , ' n ' we do n't want her disturbed . Here 's the card to mark it by , ""  and she produced a card from the table .  The man put it in his pocket , shouldered the box , and Betty shut the  door .  Not one of those good things ever went into the Jarvis dining - room !  The next morning things went on just as usual in the house . The kitchen  door was left open and Mrs. Jarvis was welcome to smell any of the  appetizing odours that wafted out into her room . Jessie resumed her  study , and especially her practice , for she hoped some day to be  a great musician . She waited on her mother and took charge of the  housekeeping , so much as was necessary with the well - tried servant at  the head of the kitchen . And though she had but sixteen years over her"	1	0
" It was Thanksgiving morning in a rough - looking little mining settlement  in Colorado . In a shanty rougher and more comfortless than the rest  were two persons : one , a man of thirty , was deeply engaged in cleaning  and oiling a gun which lay in pieces about him on the rough bench where  he sat ; the other , a youth of sixteen , was trying to make a fire burn  in the primitive - looking affair that did duty as a stove . Both wore  coarse miner 's suits , and picks and other things about the room told  that their business was to dig for the yellow dust we are all so greedy  to have .  Evidently luck had not been good , for the whole place appeared run  down , and the two looked absolutely hungry .  It was Thanksgiving morning , as I said , but no thankfulness shone in  the two pale , thin faces . Both were sad , and the younger one almost  hopeless .  "" Jack , "" said the elder , pausing in his operations , "" mind you give that  old hen a good boil , or we wo n't be able to eat it . ""  "" It 'll be better'n nothing , anyway , I suppose , "" said Jack gloomily .  "" Not much . ' Specially if you do n't get the taste of sage brush out of  it . Lucky I happened to get that shot at her , anyway , "" he went on ,  "" I 've seen worse dinners -- even Thanksgiving dinners -- than a sage hen . ""  "" I have n't , "" said Jack shortly ; for the mention of Thanksgiving had  brought up before him with startling vividness the picture of a bright  dining - room in a certain town far away , a table loaded with good  things , and surrounded by smiling faces , and the contrast was almost  more than he could bear .  "" Well , do n't be down on your luck , boy , so long as you can get a  good fat hen to eat , if she does happen to be too fond of seasoning  before she 's dead ! "" replied the other cheerfully ; "" we have n't struck  it yet , but it 's always darkest just before dawn , you know . We may be  millionaires before this time to - morrow . ""  "" We may , "" answered Jack ; but he did n't look as if he had much hope of  it .  A few hours later the occupants of the cabin sat down to their  Thanksgiving dinner . It consisted of the hen aforesaid"	1	0
" The elder sat on the bench , the younger drew up a keg that had held  powder , and the dinner was about to begin .  But that hen was destined never to be eaten , for just at that moment  the door was pushed open in the rude way of the country , a box set down  on the floor , and a rough voice announced :  "" A box for Mr. Jack Jones . ""  Jack started up .  "" For me , there must be a mistake ! Nobody knows---- "" He stopped , for he  had not mentioned that his name was assumed .  "" Likely not ! "" said the man , with a knowing look , "" but folks has a  mighty queer way of findin ' out , "" and he shut the door and left .  Jack stood staring at the box as if he had lost his wits . It could not  be from home , for no one knew where he went when he stole out of the  house one night six months ago , and ran away to seek his fortune . Not a  line had he ever written -- not even when very ill , as he had been ; not  even when without a roof to cover his head , as he had been more than  once ; not even when he had not eaten for two days , as also , alas , had  been his experience .  He had deliberately run away , because -- how trivial it looked to him  now , and how childish seemed his conduct -- because he thought his father  too hard on him ; would not allow him enough liberty ; wanted to dictate  to this man of sixteen ; he intended to show him that he could get on  alone .  Poor Jack , the only comfort he had been able to extract from his hard  lot these many months of wandering , of work , of suffering such as he  had never dreamed of -- his only comfort was that his tender mother  did n't know , his only sister would no more be worried by his grumbling  and complaints , and his father would be convinced now that he was n't a  baby . Small comfort , too , to balance the hardships that had fallen to  his lot since the money he had drawn from the savings bank -- his little  all -- was used up .  "" Why do n't you open it ? "" The gruff but not unkind voice of his  roommate , whom he called Tom , aroused him . "" Maybe there 's something in  it better'n sage hen , "" trying to raise a smile"	1	0
" It _ was _ from home ! On the very top was a letter addressed to Jack  Jarvis in a hand that he well knew .  He hastily stuffed it into his pocket unopened . The layers of paper  were removed , and as each one was thrown off , something new appeared .  Not a word was spoken , but the kettle of sage hen was silently put on  the floor by Tom as the bench began to fill up . A jar of cranberry  sauce , another of orange marmalade , oranges and apples , a plum pudding ,  a chicken pie , and lastly , in its white linen wrapper , the turkey we  saw browning in that far - off New England kitchen .  As one by one these things were lifted out and placed on the bench a  deep silence reigned in the cabin . Jack had choked at sight of the  letter , and memories of days far different from these checked even  Tom 's usually lively tongue . A strange unpacking it was ; how different  from the joyful packing at dead of night with those two laughing girl  faces bending over it !  When all was done , and the silence grew painful , Jack blurted out :  "" Help yourself , "" and bustled about , busily gathering up the papers and  folding them , and stuffing them back in the box , as though he were the  most particular housekeeper in the world . But if Jack could n't eat ,  something , too , ailed Tom . He said simply :  "" Do n't feel hungry . Believe I 'll go out and see what I can find , "" and  shouldering his gun , now cleaned and put together , he quickly went out  and shut the door .  Jack sat down on the keg and looked at the things which so vividly  brought home , and his happy life there , before him . He did not feel  hungry , either . He sat and stared for some time . Then he remembered  his letter . He drew it from his pocket and opened it . It was very  thick ; and when he pulled it out of the envelope the first thing he  saw was the smiling face of his sister Jessie , his twin sister , his  playmate and comrade , his confidante from the cradle . The loss of her  ever - willing sympathy had been almost more to him than all the rest of  his troubles .  This was another shock that brought something to his eyes that made him  see the others through a mist . There were the pictures of his mother ,  whose gentle voice"	1	0
I send you this Thanksgiving dinner . It      was too bad for you to go off so . You do n't know how      dreadful it was for mamma ; she was sick a long time ,      and we were scared to death about her , but she 's better      now ; she can sit up most all day .      Oh , Jack ! Father _ cried _ ! I 'm sure he did , and he      almost ran out of the room , and did n't say anything to      anybody all day . But I was determined I 'd find you . I      sha n't tell you how I did it , but Uncle John helped      me , and now , Jack , he says he wants just such a fellow      as you to learn his business , and he 'll make you a very      good offer . And , Jack , that 's my turkey -- my Winnie -- and      nobody but Betty knows anything about this box and this      letter . I send you all my money out of the savings bank      ( I did n't tell _ anybody _ that ) , and _ I want _ you to      come home . You 'll find the money under the cranberries .      I thought it would be safe there , and I knew you 'd eat      them all , you 're so fond of cranberries . I did n't tell      anybody because I want to surprise them , and besides ,      let them think you came home because you got ready .      It 's nobody 's business where you got the money anyway .      Now do come right home , Jack . You can get here in a      week 's time , I know .                              Your affectionate sister ,                                                      JESSIE .  Jack laid the letter down with a rush of new feelings and thoughts that  overwhelmed him . He sat there for hours ; he knew nothing of time . He  had mechanically turned the cranberry jar upside down and taken from  the bottom , carefully wrapped in white paper , fifty dollars .  A pang went through him . Well did he know what that money represented  to his sister ; by how many sacrifices she had been saving it for a year  or two , with the single purpose of taking the lessons from a great  master that were to fit her to teach , to take an independent position  in the world , to relieve her father , who had lost a large slice of his  comfortable income , and who was growing old and sad under his burden .  She had often talked it over with Jack .  Now she had generously given up the whole to him	1	0
" On Tom 's entrance he roused himself . There was a new light in his eye .  "" Come , Tom , "" he said , "" dinner 's waiting . You must be hungry by this  time . ""  "" I am that , "" said Tom , who had been through his own mental struggles  meanwhile .  The two sat down once more to their Thanksgiving dinner , and this time  they managed to eat , though Jack choked whenever he thought of tasting  a bit of Jessie 's pet turkey , Winnie ; and much as he liked turkey , and  a home turkey at that , he could not touch it .  After the meal , when the provisions were stored away in the cupboard ( a  soap box ) much too small for such a supply , it had grown quite dark ,  and the two , still disinclined to talk , went to their beds -- if the  rough bunks they occupied may be dignified by that name .  But not to sleep -- at least not Jack , who tumbled and tossed all night  and got up in the morning with an energy and life he had not shown for  weeks .  After breakfast Tom shouldered his pick and said :  "" I 'll go on , Jack , while you clear up . "" Yet he felt in his heart he  should never see Jack again ; for there was a homestruck look in his  face that the man of experience in the ways of runaway boys knew well .  He was not surprised that Jack did not join him , nor that when he  returned at night to the cabin he found him gone and a note pinned up  on the door :      I ca n't stand it -- I'm off for home . You may have my      share of everything .                                                     JACK .  It was a cold evening in early December , and there seemed to be  an undercurrent of excitement in the Jarvis household . The table  was spread in the dining - room with the best silver and linen . Mrs.  Jarvis was better , and had even been able to go into the kitchen to  superintend the preparations for dinner .  Jessie went around with a shining face that no one understood and she  could not explain .  Betty was strangely nervous , and had made several blunders that morning  which mortified the faithful servant very much . An air of expectancy  pervaded the whole house , though the two heads of it had not a hint of  the cause .  Jessie heard the train she had decided to be the important one . She  could hardly contain"	1	0
" You all know how it happened . The door opened and Jack walked in . One  instant of blank silence , and then a grand convulsion .  Jack fell on his knees with his face in his mother 's lap , though he  had not thought a moment before of doing any such thing . Jessie hung  over him , frantically hugging him . Mr. Jarvis , vainly trying to join  this group , could only lay his hands on Jack 's head and say in a broken  voice : "" My son ! My son ! "" while Betty performed a war dance around the  party , wildly brandishing a basting spoon in one hand and wiping her  streaming eyes on the dishcloth which she held in the other .  It was long before a word could be spoken , and the dinner was totally  ruined , as Betty declared with tears ( though they were not for sorrow ) ,  before any one could calm down enough to eat .  Then the reaction set in , and justice was done to the dinner , while  talk went on in a stream . Jack did not tell his adventures ; he only  said that he had come from the city , where he had made arrangements  for a situation with Uncle John -- at which Jessie 's eyes sparkled . His  looks , even after a week of comfort and hope , spoke for his sufferings .  There is little more to tell . Jack Jarvis at seventeen was a different  boy from the Jack who at sixteen started out to seek his fortune . You  may be sure that Jessie had her music lessons after all , and that a new  Winnie with a fine young brood at her heels stalked about the Jarvis  grounds the next spring .  WHO ATE THE DOLLY 'S DINNER ?  BY ISABEL GORDON CURTIS .      A good story for the Big Sister to read to the little      boys and girls .  "" WHY ca n't dollies have a Thanksgiving dinner as well as real folks ? ""  asked Polly Pine .  "" I do n't know why , "" said mamma , laughing ; "" go and dress them in their  best clothes , get the dolls ' house swept and dusted and the table  ready . Then I 'll fix their dinner before we go downstairs . ""  "" Oh , how nice ! "" said Polly Pine .  The doll house stood in the nursery . It was very big and very  beautiful . It was painted red ; it had tall chimneys , and a fine front  door with R. Bliss on a brass plate . There were lace curtains at the  windows"	1	0
"Then she set the  table in the dining - room with the very best dishes and the finest  silver . She set a teeny vase in the middle of the table , with two  violets in it , and she put dolly table napkins at each place .  When the house was all nice and clean she dressed Lavinia in her pink  muslin , and Dora Jane in her gray velvet , and Hannah Welch in her  yellow silk ; then she seated them around the table , each one in her  own chair . Polly was just telling them about company manners , how they  must not eat with their knives , or leave their teaspoons in their cups  when they drank their tea , when the door opened and in came mamma with  a real dolls ' Thanksgiving dinner .  There was a chicken bone to put on the platter before Hannah Welch ,  for Hannah always did the carving . There were cunning little dishes of  mashed potato and cranberry sauce , and some celery in a tiny tumbler ,  and the smallest squash pie baked in a patty pan . Polly Pine just  hopped up and down with delight when she saw it . She set everything on  the table ; then she ran away to put on her nicest muslin frock with the  pink ribbons , and she went downstairs to her own dinner .  There were gentlemen there for dinner -- gentlemen Polly was very fond  of -- and she had a nice time visiting with one of them . He could change  his table napkin into a white rabbit , and she forgot all about the  dolls ' Thanksgiving dinner until it was dessert - time , and the nuts and  raisins came in .  Then Polly remembered , and she jumped down from her chair and asked  mamma if she might go upstairs and see if the dolls had eaten their  dinner . When mamma told about the doll house Thanksgiving , all the  family wanted to go , too , to find out if the dolls had enjoyed their  dinner .  The front door of the doll house was open , and there sat the dolls just  as their little mistress had left them -- only they had eaten nearly all  the dinner ! Everything was gone except the potato and the cranberry  sauce . The chicken leg was picked bare , the bread was nibbled , and the  little pie was eaten all around .  "" Well , this is funny , "" said papa .  Just then they heard a funny , scratching noise in the doll house , and a  little gray mouse jumped out from under the table . He ran out"	1	0
"There was another tiny mouse in the doll house under the parlour  sofa , and a third one under Lavinia 's bed , with a poor , frightened gray  tail sticking out . They all got away safe . Papa would not allow mamma  to go for the cat . He said :  "" Why ca n't a poor little mouse have a Thanksgiving dinner as well as  we ? ""  AN OLD - FASHIONED THANKSGIVING      A long story about a family of hardy New England      pioneers in Revolutionary days . It will be most enjoyed      by the older children .  "" Pile in , Hannah . Get right down ' long o ' the clock , so 's to kinder  shore it up . I 'll fix in them pillers t'other side on't , and you can  set back ag'inst the bed . Good - bye , folks ! Gee up ! Bright . Gee ! I tell  ye , Buck . ""  "" Good - bye ! "" nodded Hannah , from the depths of the old calash which  granny had given her for a riding - hood , and her rosy face sparkled  under the green shadow like a blossom under a burdock leaf .  This was their wedding journey . Thirty long miles to be travelled , at  the slow pace of an oxcart , where to - day a railroad spins by , and a log  hut in the dim distance .  But Hannah did not cry about it . There was a momentary choking ,  perhaps , in her throat , as she caught a last view of granny 's mob cap  and her father 's rough face , with the red head of her small stepbrother  between them , grouped in the doorway . Her mother had died long ago , and  there was another in her place now , and a swarm of children . Hannah was  going to her own home , to a much easier life , and going with John . Why  should she cry ?  Besides , Hannah was the merriest little woman in the country . She had a  laugh always lying ready in a convenient dimple .  She never knew what "" blues "" meant , except to dye stocking yarn . She  was sunny as a dandelion and gay as a bobolink . Her sweet good nature  never failed through the long day 's journey , and when night came she  made a pot of tea at the campfire , roasted a row of apples , and broiled  a partridge John shot by the wayside , with as much enjoyment as if  this was the merriest picnic excursion , and not a solitary camp in the  forest , long miles"	1	0
"Hannah watched his fine , grave face , as  the flickering light illuminated it , for a few minutes , and then slept  tranquilly till dawn . And by sunset next day the little party drew up  at the door of the log hut they called home .  It looked very pretty to Hannah . She had the fairy gift , that is so  rare among mortals , of seeing beauty in its faintest expression ; and  the young grass about the rough stone doorstep , the crimson cones on  the great larch tree behind it , the sunlit panes of the west window ,  the laugh and sparkle of the brook that ran through the clearing , the  blue eyes of the squirrel caps that blossomed shyly and daintily beside  the stumps of new - felled trees -- all these she saw and delighted in .  And when the door was open , the old clock set up , the bed laid on the  standing bedplace , and the three chairs and table ranged against the  wall , she began her housewifery directly , singing as she went . Before  John had put his oxen in the small barn , sheltered the cart and the  tools in it , and shaken down hay into the manger , Hannah had made a  fire , hung on the kettle , spread up her bed with homespun sheets and  blankets and a wonderful cover of white - and - red chintz , set the table  with a loaf of bread , a square of yellow butter , a bowl of maple sugar ,  and a plate of cheese ; and even released the cock and the hen from  their uneasy prison in a splint basket , and was feeding them in the  little woodshed when John came in .  His face lit up , as he entered , with that joyful sense of home so  instinctive in every true man and woman . He rubbed his hard hands  together , and catching Hannah as she came in at the shed door , bestowed  upon her a resounding kiss .  "" You 're the most of a little woman I ever see , Hannah , I swan to man . ""  Hannah laughed like a swarm of spring blackbirds . "" I declare , John ,  you do beat all ! Ai n't it real pleasant here ? Seems to me I never saw  things so handy . ""  Oh , Hannah , what if your prophetic soul could have foreseen the  conveniences of this hundred years after ! Yet the shelves , the pegs ,  the cupboard in the corner , the broad shelf above the fire , the great  pine chest under the window , and the clumsy"	1	0
"Hard  work and hard fare lay before them both , but they were not daunted by  the prospect ....  By and by a cradle entered the door , and a baby was laid in it ....  One baby is well enough in a log cabin , with one room for all the  purposes of life ; but when next year brought two more , a pair of stout  boys , then John began to saw lumber for his own use . A bedroom was  built on the east side of the house , and a rough stairway into the  loft -- more room perhaps than was needed ; but John was called in Nepash  "" a dre'dful forecastin ' man , "" and he took warning from the twins .  And timely warning it proved , for as the years slipped by , one after  another , they left their arrows in his quiver till ten children bloomed  about the hearth . The old cabin had disappeared entirely . A good - sized  frame house of one story , with a high - pitched roof , stood in its stead ,  and a slab fence kept roving animals out of the yard and saved the  apple trees from the teeth of stray cows and horses .  Poor enough they were still . The loom in the garret always had its web  ready , the great wheel by the other window sung its busy song year in  and year out . Dolly was her mother 's right hand now ; and the twins ,  Ralph and Reuben , could fire the musket and chop wood . Sylvy , the  fourth child , was the odd one . All the rest were sturdy , rosy , laughing  girls and boys ; but Sylvy had been a pining baby , and grew up into a  slender , elegant creature , with clear gray eyes , limpid as water , but  bright as stars , and fringed with long golden lashes the colour of her  beautiful hair -- locks that were coiled in fold on fold at the back of  her fine head , like wreaths of undyed silk , so pale was their yellow  lustre . She bloomed among the crowd of red - cheeked , dark - haired lads  and lasses , stately and incongruous as a June lily in a bed of tulips .  But Sylvy did not stay at home . The parson 's lady at Litchfield came to  Nepash one Sunday , with her husband , and seeing Sylvy in the square  corner pew with the rest , was mightily struck by her lovely face ,  and offered to take her home with her the next week , for the better  advantages of schooling .

" They could not part with her , and at last adopted her formally as their  daughter , with the unwilling consent of John and Hannah . Yet they knew  it was greatly "" for Sylvy 's betterment , "" as they phrased it ; so at last  they let her go .  But when Dolly was a sturdy young woman of twenty - five the war - trumpet  blew , and John and the twins heard it effectually . There was a sudden  leaving of the plow in the furrow . The planting was set aside for the  children to finish , the old musket rubbed up , and with set lips and  resolute eyes the three men walked away one May morning to join the  Nepash company . Hannah kept up her smiling courage through it all .  If her heart gave way , nobody knew it but God and John . The boys she  encouraged and inspired , and the children were shamed out of their  childish tears by mother 's bright face and cheery talk .  Then she set them all to work . There was corn to plant , wheat to sow ,  potatoes to set ; flax and wool to spin and weave , for clothes would be  needed for all , both absent and stay - at - homes . There was no father to  superintend the outdoor work ; so Hannah took the field , and marshalled  her forces on Nepasset Brook much as the commander - in - chief was doing  on a larger scale elsewhere . Eben , the biggest boy , and Joey , who came  next him , were to do all the planting ; Diana and Sam took on themselves  the care of the potato patch , the fowls , and the cow ; Dolly must spin  and weave when mother left either the wheel or loom to attend to the  general ordering of the forces ; while Obed and Betty , the younglings  of the flock , were detailed to weed , pick vegetables ( such few as  were raised in the small garden ) , gather berries , herbs , nuts , hunt  the straying turkeys ' nests , and make themselves generally useful .  At evening all the girls sewed ; the boys mended their shoes , having  learned so much from a travelling cobbler ; and the mother taught them  all her small stock of schooling would allow . At least , they each  knew how to read , and most of them to write , after a very uncertain  fashion . As to spelling , nobody knew how to spell in those days ....  But they did know the four simple rules of arithmetic , and could say  the epigrammatic"	1	0
" Father and the boys were fighting now , and mother 's merry words were  more rare , though her bright face still wore its smiling courage .  They heard rarely from the army . Now and then a post rider stopped  at the Nepash tavern and brought a few letters or a little news ; but  this was at long intervals , and women who watched and waited at home  without constant mail service and telegraphic flashes , aware that news  of disaster , of wounds , of illness , could only reach them too late to  serve or save , and that to reach the ill or the dying involved a larger  and more disastrous journey than the survey of half the world demands  now -- these women endured pangs beyond our comprehension , and endured  them with a courage and patience that might have furnished forth an  army of heroes , that did go far to make heroes of that improvised ,  ill - conditioned , eager multitude who conquered the trained bands of  their oppressors and set their sons "" free and equal , "" to use their own  dubious phraseology , before the face of humanity at large .  By and by winter came on with all its terrors . By night wolves howled  about the lonely house , and sprung back over the palings when Eben  went to the door with his musket . Joe hauled wood from the forest  on a hand - sled , and Dolly and Diana took it in through the kitchen  window when the drifts were so high that the woodshed door could not  be opened . Besides , all the hens were gathered in there , as well for  greater warmth as for convenience in feeding , and the barn was only to  be reached with snowshoes and entered by the window above the manger .  Hard times these were . The loom in the garret could not be used , for  even fingers would freeze in that atmosphere ; so the thread was wound  off , twisted on the great wheel , and knit into stockings , the boys  learning to fashion their own , while Hannah knit her anxiety and her  hidden heartaches into socks for her soldier boys and their father .  By another spring the aching and anxiousness were a little dulled , for  habit blunts even the keen edge of mortal pain . They had news that  summer that Ralph had been severely wounded , but had recovered ; that  John had gone through a sharp attack of camp - fever ; that Reuben was  taken prisoner , but escaped by his own wit . Hannah was thankful and  grateful beyond expression . Perhaps another woman would have wept and"	1	0
"  After that she always thought her mother saw the sun when nobody else  could . And in a spiritual sense it was true .  Parson Everett rode over once or twice from Litchfield that next  summer to fetch Sylvia and to administer comfort to Hannah . He was a  quaint , prim little gentleman , neat as any wren , but mild - mannered as  wrens never are , and in a moderate way kindly and sympathetic . When  the children had haled their lovely sister away to see their rustic  possessions , Parson Everett would sit down in a high chair , lay aside  his cocked hat , spread his silk pocket handkerchief over his knees , and  prepare to console Hannah .   Mistress Perkins , these are trying times , trying times . There is a  sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry - trees -- h - m ! Sea and waves  roaring of a truth -- h - m ! h - m ! I trust , Mistress Perkins , you submit to  the Divine Will with meekness . ""  "" Well , I do n't know , "" replied Hannah , with a queer little twinkle in  her eye . "" I do n't believe I be as meek as Moses , parson . I should like  things fixed different , to speak truth . ""  "" Dear me ! Dear me -- h - m ! h - m ! My good woman , the Lord reigneth . You must  submit ; you must submit . You know it is the duty of a vessel of wrath  to be broken to pieces if it glorifieth the Maker . ""  "" Well , mebbe ' tis . I do n't know much about that kind o ' vessel . I 've  got to submit because there ai n't anything else to do , as I see . I  ca n't say it goes easy -- not'n ' be honest ; but I try to look on the  bright side , and to believe the Lord'll take care of my folks better'n  I could , even if they was here . ""  "" H - m ! h - m ! Well , "" stammered the embarrassed parson , completely at his  wit 's end with this cheerful theology , "" well , I hope it is grace that  sustains you , Mistress Perkins , and not the vain elation of the natural  man . The Lord is in His holy temple ; the earth is His footstool -- h - m ! ""  The parson struggled helplessly with a tangle of texts here ; but the  right one seemed to fail him , till Hannah audaciously put it in"	1	0
"You fetch a person down to the  bedrock , as Grandsir Penlyn used to say , and then they know where they  be . And ef the Lord is really the Lord of all , I expect He 'll take care  of all ; ' nd I do n't doubt but what He is and does . So I can fetch up on  that . ""  Parson Everett heaved a deep sigh , put on his cocked hat , and blew his  nose ceremonially with the silk handkerchief . Not that he needed to :  but as a sort of shaking off of the dust of responsibility and ending  the conversation , which , if it was not heterodox on Hannah 's part ,  certainly did not seem orthodox to him .... He did not try to console  her any more , but contented himself with the stiller spirits in his  own parish , who had grown up in and after his own fashion .  Another dreadful winter settled down on Nepasset township . There was  food enough in the house and firewood in the shed ; but neither food nor  fire seemed to assuage the terrible cold , and with decreased vitality  decreased courage came to all . Hygienics were an unforeseen mystery  to people of that day . They did not know that nourishing food is as  good for the brain as for the muscles . They lived on potatoes , beets ,  beans , with now and then a bit of salt pork or beef boiled in the pot  with the rest ; and their hearts failed , as their flesh did , with this  sodden and monotonous diet . One ghastly night Hannah almost despaired .  She held secret council with Dolly and Eben , while they inspected the  potato bin and the pork barrel , as to whether it would not be best for  them to break up and find homes elsewhere for the winter . Her father  was old and feeble . He would be glad to have her with him and Betty .  The rest were old enough to "" do chores "" for their board , and there were  many families where help was needed , both in Nepash and Litchfield ,  since every available man had gone to the war by this time . But while  they talked a great scuffling and squawking in the woodhouse attracted  the boys upstairs . Joe seized the tongs and Diana the broomstick .  An intruding weasel was pursued and slaughtered ; but not till two  fowls , fat and fine , had been sacrificed by the invader and the tongs  together . The children were all hungry , with the exhaustion of the  cold weather , and clamoured to have these"	1	0
"It 'll be spring after a while , and  we 'll stick it out together . ""  "" I guess I would , "" answered Dolly . "" And do n't you believe we should  all feel better to kill off them fowls -- all but two or three ? They 're  master hands to eat corn , and it does seem as though that biled hen  done us all a sight o ' good to - night . Just hear them children . ""  And it certainly was , as Hannah said , "" musical to hear ' em . "" Joe had a  cornstalk fiddle , and Eben an old singing book , which Diana read over  his shoulder while she kept on knitting her blue sock ; and the three  youngsters -- Sam , Obed , and Betty -- with wide mouths and intent eyes ,  followed Diana 's "" lining out "" of that quaint hymn "" The Old Israelites , ""  dwelling with special gusto and power on two of the verses :        "" We are little , ' tis true ,         And our numbers are few ,      And the sons of old Anak are tall ;         But while I see a track         I will never go back ,      But go on at the risk of my all .        "" The way is all new ,         As it opens to view ,      And behind is the foaming Red Sea ;         So none need to speak         Of the onions and leeks      Or to talk about garlics to me ! ""  Hannah 's face grew brighter still . "" We 'll stay right here ! "" she said ,  adding her voice to the singular old ditty with all her power :        "" What though some in the rear         Preach up terror and fear ,      And complain of the trials they meet ,         Tho ' the giants before         With great fury do roar ,      I 'm resolved I can never retreat . ""  And in this spirit , sustained , no doubt , by the occasional chickens ,  they lived the winter out , till blessed , beneficent spring came again ,  and brought news , great news , with it . Not from the army , though .  There had been a post rider in Nepash during the January thaw , and he  brought short letters only . There was about to be a battle , and there  was no time to write more than assurances of health and good hopes for  the future . Only once since had news reached them from that quarter .  A disabled man from the Nepash company was brought home dying with  consumption . Hannah felt almost ashamed to rejoice"	1	0
"It was only when her eight  children rejoiced in the hearing that she dared to be happy . But the  other news was from Sylvia . She was promised to the schoolmaster in  Litchfield . Only to think of it ! Our Sylvy !  Master Loomis had been eager to go to the war ; but his mother was  a poor bedrid woman , dependent on him for support , and all the  dignitaries of the town combined in advising and urging him to stay  at home for the sake of their children , as well as his mother . So at  home he stayed , and fell into peril of heart , instead of life and  limb , under the soft fire of Sylvia 's eyes , instead of the enemy 's  artillery . Parson Everett could not refuse his consent , though he and  madam were both loth to give up their sweet daughter . But since she and  the youth seemed to be both of one mind about the matter , and he being  a godly young man , of decent parentage , and in a good way of earning  his living , there was no more to be said . They would wait a year before  thinking of marriage , both for better acquaintance and on account of  the troubled times .  "" Mayhap the times will mend , sir , "" anxiously suggested the schoolmaster  to Parson Everett .  "" I think not , I think not , Master Loomis . There is a great blackness of  darkness in hand , the Philistines be upon us , and there is moving to  and fro . Yea , Behemoth lifteth himself and shaketh his mane -- h - m ! ah !  h - m ! It is not a time for marrying and giving in marriage , for playing  on sackbuts and dulcimers -- h - m ! ""  A quiet smile flickered around Master Loomis 's mouth as he turned  away , solaced by a shy , sweet look from Sylvia 's limpid eyes , as he  peeped into the keeping - room , where she sat with madam , on his way  out . He could afford to wait a year for such a spring blossom as that ,  surely . And wait he did , with commendable patience , comforting his  godly soul with the fact that Sylvia was spared meantime the daily  tendance and care of a fretful old woman like his mother ; for , though  Master Loomis was the best of sons , that did not blind him to the  fact that the irritability of age and illness were fully developed in  his mother , and he alone seemed to have the power of calming her"	1	0
"So the summer rolled away . Hannah  and her little flock tilled their small farm and gathered plenteous  harvest . Mindful of last year 's experience , they raised brood after  brood of chickens , and planted extra acres of corn for their feeding ,  so that when autumn came , with its vivid , splendid days , its keen winds  and turbulent skies , the new chicken yard , which the boys had worked  at through the summer , with its wattled fence , its own tiny spring ,  and lofty covered roofs , swarmed with chickens , ducks , and turkeys .  Many a dollar was brought home about Thanksgiving time for the fat  fowls sold in Litchfield and Nepash ; but dollars soon vanished in  buying winter clothes for so many children , or rather , in buying wool  to spin and weave for them . Mahala Green , the village tailoress , came  to fashion the garments , and the girls sewed them . Uncouth enough was  their aspect ; but fashion did not yet reign in Nepash , and if they were  warm , who cared for elegance ? Not Hannah 's rosy , hearty , happy brood .  They sang and whistled and laughed with a force and freedom that was  kin to the birds and squirrels among whom they lived ; and Hannah 's  kindly , cheery face lit up as she heard them , while a half sigh told  that her husband and her soldier boys were still wanting to her perfect  contentment .  At last they were all housed snugly for winter . The woodpile was larger  than ever before , and all laid up in the shed , beyond which a rough  shelter of chinked logs had been put up for the chickens , to which  their roosts and nest boxes , of coarse wicker , boards nailed together ,  hollow bark from the hemlock logs , even worn - out tin pails , had all  been transferred . The cellar had been well banked from the outside ,  and its darksome cavern held good store of apples , pork , and potatoes .  There was dried beef in the stairway , squashes in the cupboard ,  flour in the pantry , and the great gentle black cow in the barn was  a wonderful milker . In three weeks Thanksgiving would come , and even  Hannah 's brave heart sank as she thought of her absent husband and  boys ; and their weary faces rose up before her as she numbered over  to herself her own causes for thankfulness , as if to say : "" Can you  keep Thanksgiving without us ? "" Poor Hannah ! She did her best to set  these thankless thoughts"	1	0
"Master  Loomis 's mother was dead , and the master himself , seeing there was  a new levy of troops , was now going to the war . But before he went  there was to be a wedding , and , in the good old fashion , it should be  on Thanksgiving Day , and Madam Everett had bidden as many of Sylvy 's  people to the feast as would come .  There was great excitement as Hannah read aloud the madam 's note . The  tribe of Perkins shouted for joy , but a sudden chill fell on them when  mother spoke :  "" Now , children , hush up ! I want to speak myself , ef it 's a possible  thing to git in a word edgeways . We ca n't all go , fust and foremost .  ' Tain't noways possible . ""  "" Oh , Mother ! Why ? Oh , do ! Not go to Sylvy 's wedding ? "" burst in the  "" infinite deep chorus "" of youngsters .  "" No , you ca n't . There ai n't no team in the county big enough to hold ye  all , if ye squeeze ever so much . I 've got to go , for Sylvy'd be beat  out if mother did n't come . And Dolly 's the oldest . She 's got a right to  go . ""  Loud protest was made against the right of primogeniture , but mother  was firm .  "" Says so in the Bible . Leastways , Bible folks always acted so . The  first - born , ye know . Dolly 's goin' , sure . Eben 's got to drive , and I  must take Obed . He 'd be the death of somebody , with his everlastin '  mischief , if I left him to home . Mebbe I can squeeze in Betty , to keep  him company . Joe and Sam and Dianner wo n't be more'n enough to take  care o ' the cows and chickens and fires , and all . Likewise of each  other . ""  Sam set up a sudden howl at his sentence , and kicked the mongrel yellow  puppy , who leaped on him to console him , till that long - suffering beast  yelped in concert .  Diana sniffed and snuffled , scrubbed her eyes with her checked apron ,  and rocked back and forth .  "" Now , stop it ! "" bawled Joe . "" For the land 's sake , quit all this noise .  We ca n't all on us go ; ' n ' for my part , I do n't want to . We 'll hev a  weddin ' of our own some day"	1	0
"Now , let 's see . Betty , she 's  got that chintz gown that was your Sunday best , Dolly -- the flowered  one , you know , that Dianner outgrowed . We must fix them lawn ruffles  into ' t ; and there 's a blue ribbin laid away in my chest o ' drawers  that 'll tie her hair . It 's dreadful lucky we 've got new shoes all  round ; and Obed 's coat and breeches is as good as new , if they be made  out of his pa 's weddin ' suit . That 's the good o ' good cloth . It 'll last  most forever . Joe he d 'em first , then Sam wore 'em quite a spell , and  they cut over jest right for Obey . My black paduasoy can be fixed up , I  guess . But , my stars ! Dolly , what hev ' you got ? ""  "" Well , Mother , you know I ai n't got a real good gown . There 's the  black lutestring petticoat Sylvy fetched me two years ago ; but there  ai n't any gown to it . We calculated I could wear that linsey jacket to  meeting , under my coat ; but ' twouldn't do rightly for a weddin ' . ""  "" That 's gospel truth . You ca n't wear that , anyhow . You 've got to hev  somethin' . ' Twon't do to go to Sylvy 's weddin ' in linsey woolsy ; but I  do n't believe there 's more'n two hard dollars in the house . There 's a  few Continentals ; but I do n't count on them . Joe , you go over to the  mill fust thing in the morning and ask Sylvester to lend me his old  mare a spell to - morrer , to ride over to Nepash , to the store . ""  "" Why do n't ye send Doll ? "" asked Joe , with a wicked glance at the girl  that set her blushing again .  "" Hold your tongue , Joseph , ' n ' mind me . It 's bedtime now , but I 'll wake  ye up airly , "" energetically remarked Hannah . And next day , equipped in  cloak and hood , she climbed the old mare 's fat sides and jogged off on  her errand ; and by noon - mark was safe and sound home again , looking a  little perplexed , but by no means cast down .  "" Well , Dolly , "" said she , as soon as cloak and hood were laid aside ,  "" there 's the beautifulest piece of chintz over to the store you ever  see -- jest"	1	0
" Squire Dart would n't take no money for ' t. He 's awful sharp about them  new bills . Sez they ai n't no more'n corn husks . Well , we ai n't got a  great lot of 'em , so there 's less to lose , and some folks will take  'em ; but he 'll let me have the chintz for ' leven yards o ' soldier 's  cloth -- blue , ye know , like what we sent pa and the boys . And I spent  them two silver dollars on a white gauze neckkercher and a piece of red  satin ribbin for ye , for I 'm set on that chintz . Now hurry up ' nd fix  the loom right off . The web 's ready , then we 'll card the wool . I 'll  lay ye a penny we 'll have them ' leven yards wove by Friday . To - day 's  Tuesday , Thanksgiving comes a Thursday week , an ' ef we have the chintz  by sundown a Saturday there 'll be good store of time for Mahaly Green  and you to make it afore Wednesday night . We 'll hev a kind of a  Thanksgiving , after all . But I wisht your pa---- "" The sentence ended in  Hannah 's apron at her eyes , and Dolly looked sober ; but in a minute she  dimpled and brightened , for the pretty chintz gown was more to her than  half a dozen costly French dresses to a girl of to - day . But a little  cloud suddenly put out the dimples .  "" But , Mother , if somebody else should buy it ? ""  "" Oh , they wo n't . I 've fixed that . I promised to fetch the cloth inside  of a week , and Squire Dart laid away the chintz for me till that time .  Fetch the wool , Dolly , before you set up the web , so 's I can start . ""  The wool was carded , spun , washed , and put into the dye tub , one "" run ""  of yarn that night ; and another spun and washed by next day 's noon -- for  the stuff was to be checked , and black wool needed no dyeing . Swiftly  hummed the wheel , merrily flew the shuttle , and the house steamed with  inodorous dye ; but nobody cared for that , if the cloth could only  be finished . And finished it was -- the full measure and a yard over ;  and on Saturday morning Sylvester 's horse was borrowed again , and  Hannah came back from the village beaming with pleasure , and bringing  besides the chintz a yard of"	1	0
"A dark green grosgrain  petticoat and white lawn ruffles made a sufficiently picturesque attire  for Hannah , whose well - silvered hair set off her still sparkling  eyes and clear healthy skin . She appeared in this unwonted finery on  Thanksgiving morning to her admiring family , having added a last touch  of adornment by a quaint old jet necklace , that glittered on the pure  lawn neckkerchief with as good effect as a chain of diamonds and much  more fitness . Betty , in her striped blue - and - white chintz , a clean  dimity petticoat , and a blue ribbon round her short brown curls , looked  like a cabbage rosebud -- so sturdy and wholesome and rosy that no more  delicate symbol suits her .  Obed was dreadful in the old - fashioned costume of coat and breeches ,  ill - fitting and shiny with wear , and his freckled face and round  shock head of tan - coloured hair thrown into full relief by a big ,  square collar of coarse tatten lace laid out on his shoulders like  a barber 's towel , and illustrating the great red ears that stood  out at right angles above it . But Obed was only a boy . He was not  expected to be more than clean and speechless ; and , to tell the truth ,  Eben , being in the hobbledehoy stage of boyhood -- gaunt , awkward , and  self - sufficient -- rather surpassed his small brother in unpleasant  aspect and manner . But who would look at the boys when Dolly stood  beside them , as she did now , tall and slender , with the free grace of  an untrammelled figure , her small head erect , her eyes dark and soft as  a deer 's , neatly clothed feet ( not too small for her height ) peeping  from under the black lutestring petticoat , and her glowing brunette  complexion set off by the picturesque buff - and - garnet chintz gown ,  while her round throat and arms were shaded by delicate gauze and  snowy lace , and about her neck lay her mother 's gold beads , now and  then tangling in the heavy black curls that , tied high on her head with  a garnet ribbon , still dropped in rich luxuriance to her trim waist .  The family approved of Dolly , no doubt , though their phrases of  flattery were as homely as heartfelt .  "" Orful slick - lookin ' , ai n't she ? "" confided Joe to Eben ; while sinful  Sam shrieked out : "" Land o ' Goshen ! ai n't our Dolly smart ? Sha n't I  fetch Sylvester over ? ""  For which"	1	0
" With many parting charges from Hannah about the fires and fowls , the  cow , the hasty pudding , already put on for its long boil , and the  turkey that hung from a string in front of the fire and must be watched  well , since it was the Thanksgiving dinner , the "" weddingers , "" as Joe  called them , were well packed in with blankets and hot stones and set  off on their long drive .  The day was fair and bright , the fields of snow purely dazzling ; but  the cold was fearful , and in spite of all their wraps , the keen winds  that whistled over those broad hilltops where the road lay seemed  to pierce their very bones , and they were heartily glad to draw up ,  by twelve o'clock , at the door of the parsonage and be set before a  blazing fire , and revived with sundry mugs of foaming and steaming  flip , made potent with a touch of old peach brandy ; for in those  ancient days , even in parsonages , the hot poker knew its office and  sideboards were not in vain .  There was food , also , for the exhausted guests , though the refection  was slight and served informally in the kitchen corner , for the  ceremonial Thanksgiving dinner was to be deferred till after the  wedding . And as soon as all were warmed and refreshed they were ushered  into the great parlour , where a Turkey carpet , amber satin curtains ,  spider - legged chairs and tables , and a vast carved sofa , cushioned also  with amber , made a regal and luxurious show in the eyes of our rustic  observers .  But when Sylvy came in with the parson , who could look at furniture ?  Madam Everett had lavished her taste and her money on the lovely  creature as if she were her own daughter , for she was almost as dear to  that tender , childless soul . The girl 's lustrous gold - brown hair was  dressed high upon her head in soft puffs and glittering curls , and a  filmy thread - lace scarf pinned across it with pearl - headed pins . Her  white satin petticoat showed its rich lustre under a lutestring gown of  palest rose brocaded with silver sprigs and looped with silver ribbon  and pink satin roses . Costly lace clung about her neck and arms , long  kid gloves covered her little hands and wrists and met the delicate  sleeve ruffles , and about her white throat a great pink topaz clasped a  single string of pearls . Hannah could scarce believe her eyes . Was this  her Sylvy?--she who even"	1	0
"   No more you could , Sylvy . The gown is amazing fine , to be sure ; but  as long as my Sylvy 's inside of it I wo n't gainsay the gown . It ai n't  a speck too pretty for the wearer , dear . "" And Hannah gave her another  hug . The rest scarce dared to touch that fair face , except Dolly , who  threw her arms about her beautiful sister , with little thought of her  garments , but a sudden passion of love and regret sending the quick  blood to her dark brows and wavy hair in a scarlet glow .  Master Loomis looked on with tender eyes . He felt the usual masculine  conviction that nobody loved Sylvy anywhere near as much as he did ;  but it pleased him to see that she was dear to her family . The parson ,  however , abruptly put an end to the scene .  "" H - m ! my dear friends , let us recollect ourselves . There is a time for  all things . Yea , earth yieldeth her increase -- h - m ! The Lord ariseth to  shake visibly the earth -- ahem ! Sylvia , will you stand before the sophy ?  Master Lummis on the right side . Let us pray . ""  But even as he spoke the words a great knocking pealed through the  house : the brass lion 's head on the front door beat a reveille loud and  long . The parson paused , and Sylvia grew whiter than before ; while  Decius , the parson 's factotum , a highly respectable old negro ( who ,  with his wife and daughter , sole servants of the house , had stolen in  to see the ceremony ) , ambled out to the vestibule in most undignified  haste . There came sounds of dispute , much tramping of boots , rough  voices , and quick words ; then a chuckle from Decius , the parlour door  burst open , and three bearded , ragged , eager men rushed in upon the  little ceremony .  There was a moment 's pause of wonder and doubt , then a low cry from  Hannah , as she flew into her husband 's arms ; and in another second  the whole family had closed around the father and brothers , and for  once the hardy , stern , reticent New England nature , broken up from  its foundations , disclosed its depths of tenderness and fidelity .  There were tears , choking sobs , cries of joy . The madam held her lace  handkerchief to her eyes with real need of it ; Master Loomis choked for  sympathy ; and the parson blew"	1	0
"There was  no stumbling over misapplied texts now , no awkward objections in his  throat , but only glowing Bible words of thankfulness and praise and  joy . And every heart was uplifted and calm as they joined in the "" Amen . ""  John 's story was quickly told . Their decimated regiment was disbanded ,  to be reformed of fresh recruits , and a long furlough given to the  faithful but exhausted remnant . They had left at once for home , and  their shortest route lay through Litchfield . Night was near when  they reached the town , but they must needs stop to get one glimpse  of Sylvy and tidings from home , for fear lay upon them lest there  might be trouble there which they knew not of . So they burst in upon  the wedding . But Master Loomis began to look uneasy . Old Dorcas had  slipped out , to save the imperilled dinner , and Pokey , the maid ( _ n√©e _  Pocahontas ! ) could be heard clinking glass and silver and pushing about  chairs ; but the happy family were still absorbed in each other .  "" Mister Everett ! "" said the madam , with dignity , and the little minister  trotted rapturously over to her chair to receive certain low orders .  "" Yes , verily , yes -- h - m ! A -- my friends , we are assembled in this place  this evening---- ""  A sharp look from madam recalled him to the fact that this was not a  prayer - meeting .  "" A -- that is -- yes , of a truth our purpose this afternoon was to---- ""  "" That 's so ! "" energetically put in Captain John . "" Right about face !  Form ! "" and the three Continentals sprung to their feet and assumed  their position , while Sylvy and Master Loomis resumed theirs , a  flitting smile in Sylvia 's tearful eyes making a very rainbow .  So the ceremony proceeded to the end , and was wound up with a short  prayer , concerning which Captain Perkins irreverently remarked to his  wife some days after :  "" Parson smelt the turkey , sure as shootin ' , Hannah . He shortened up so  ' mazin ' quick on that prayer . I tell you I was glad on't . I knew how he  felt . I could ha ' ate a wolf myself . ""  Then they all moved in to the dinner table -- a strange group , from  Sylvia 's satin and pearls to the ragged fatigue - dress of her father and  brothers ; but there was no help for that now , and really it troubled "	1	0
"Eat and be glad , for  seldom hath there been such cause and need to keep a Thanksgiving ! ""  And they all said Amen !  1800 AND FROZE TO DEATH      An exciting story of a battle with a crazy moose . It      has a Thanksgiving flavour , too .  "" What shall we have for Thanksgiving dinner ? "" was a question which  distressed more than one household that year . Indeed , it was often a  question what to have for dinner , supper , or breakfast on any day .  For that was the strangely unpropitious , unproductive season of 1816 ,  quaintly known in local annals as "" 1800 and Froze to Death . ""  It was shortly after the close of the War of 1812 with England . Our  country was then poor and but little cultivated . There was no golden  West to send carloads of wheat and corn ; no Florida or California to  send fruit ; there were no cars , no railroads . What the people of the  Eastern States had they must raise for themselves , and that year there  were no crops .  Nothing grew , nothing ripened properly . Winter lingered even in the lap  of May. As late as the middle of June there was a heavy snowstorm in  New England . Frosts occurred every fortnight of the season . The seed  potatoes , corn , and beans , when planted , either rotted in the ground  or came up to be killed by the frosts . The cold continued through July  and August . A little barley , still less wheat and rye , a few oats , in  favourable situations , were the only cereals harvested , and these were  much pinched in the kernel .  Actual starvation threatened hundreds of farmers ' families as this  singular summer and autumn advanced . The corn crop , then the main  staple in the East , was wholly cut off . Two and three dollars a  bushel -- equal to ten dollars to - day -- were paid for corn that year -- by  those who had the money to purchase it . Many of the poorer families  subsisted in part on the boiled sprouts of raspberry and other shrubs .  Starving children stole forth into the fields of the less indigent  farmers by night , and dug up the seed potatoes and sprouted corn to eat  raw .  Moreover , there appeared to be little or no game in the forest ; many  roving bears were seen , and wolves were bold . All wild animals , indeed ,  behaved abnormally , as if they , too , felt that nature was out of joint .  The eggs of"	1	0
"Even the song birds fell into the  "" dumps "" and neglected to rear young .  The dreary , fruitless autumn drew on ; and Thanksgiving Day bade fair to  be such a hollow mockery that in several states the governors did not  issue proclamations .  Maine at that time was a part of the state of Massachusetts . My  impression is that the governor appointed November 28th as Thanksgiving  Day , but I am not sure . It is likely that not much unction attended the  announcement . The notices of it did not reach many localities in Maine .  In the neighbourhood where my grandparents lived , in Oxford County ,  nothing was heard of it ; but at a schoolhouse meeting , on November  21st , our nearest neighbour , Jonas Edwards , made a motion "" that the  people of the place keep the 28th of the month as Thanksgiving Day -- the  best they could . ""  The motion prevailed ; and then the poor housewives began to ask the  question , "" What shall we have for Thanksgiving dinner ? "" At our house it  is still remembered that one of my young great - uncles cried in reply ,  "" Oh , if we could only have a good big johnnycake ! ""  And it was either that very night , or the night after , that the  exciting news came of the arrival of a shipload of corn at Bath and  Brunswick .  At Brunswick , seat of the then infant Bowdoin College , Freeport ,  Topsham , and other towns near the coast of Maine , where the people were  interested in maritime ventures , it had become known that a surplus of  corn was raised in Cuba , and could be purchased at a fair price . An old  schooner , commanded by one Capt . John Simmons , was fitted out to sail  for a cargo of the precious cereal . For three months not a word was  heard from schooner or skipper .  Captain Simmons had purchased corn , however , and loaded his crazy old  craft full to the deck with it . Heavy weather and head winds held him  back on his voyage home . Water got to the corn , and some of it swelled  to such an extent that the old schooner was like to burst . But it got  in at last , early in November , with three thousand bushels of this West  India corn .  How the news of this argosy flew even to towns a day 's journey up from  the coast !  A great hunger for corncake swept through that part of the state ; and  in our own little neighbourhood a"	1	0
"On top of it all there  were three large bagfuls of hay for the horses . The boys also took an  axe and an old flintlock gun , for much of the way was then through  forest .  It was a long day 's drive for horses in poor condition , but they  reached Brunswick that night . There , however , they found the cargo of  corn so nearly sold out , or bartered away , that they were able to get  but three bushels to bring home .  The corn was reckoned at nine dollars , the four sheep at only six  dollars , and it had been difficult "" dickering "" the fifteen pounds of  wool and the two bushels of barley as worth three dollars more . The  extra two bushels of barley went for their keep overnight . Such was  produce exchange in 1816 .  The next morning they started for home , lightly loaded with their  dearly bought corn . Their route lay along the Androscoggin River , and  they had got as far on their way as the present factory town of Auburn ,  where the Little Androscoggin flows into the larger river of the same  name , when they had an adventure which resulted in very materially  increasing the weight of their load .  It was a raw , cloudy day , and had begun to "" spit snow "" ; and as it drew  toward noon , they stopped beside the road at a place where a large pine  and several birches leaned out from the brink of the deep gorge through  which the Little Androscoggin flows to join the larger stream . Here  they fed their horses on the last of the three bagfuls of hay , but had  nothing to cook or eat in the way of food themselves . The weather was  chilly , and my young Great - uncle Nathaniel said to Jonathan :  "" If you will get some dry birchbark , I will flash the pan . We will  kindle a fire and warm up . ""  Jonathan brought the bark , and meanwhile Nathaniel drew the charge from  the old "" Queen 's arm , "" then ignited some powder in the pan with the  flintlock , and started a blaze going .  The blaze , however , had soon to be fed with dry fuel , and noticing a  dead firtop lying on the ground a few steps away , Jonathan took the  axe and ran to break it up ; and the axe strokes among the dry stuff  made a considerable crackling .  Throwing down the axe at last , Jonathan gathered up a large armful of  the dry branches , and had turned to the"	1	0
"Jonathan , too , threw down his  armful of boughs and turned back to get the axe .  Before they could do either , however , the strange grunts and crashes  came nearer , and a moment later a pair of broad antlers and a huge  black head appeared , coming up from the gorge .  At sight of the snorting beast , Jonathan turned suddenly . "" It 's a  moose , Nat ! "" he cried . "" A big bull moose ! Shoot him ! Shoot him ! ""  Nat was making frantic efforts , but the gun was not reloaded .  Recharging an old "" Queen 's arm "" was a work of time .  Fortunately for the boys , the attention of the moose was full fixed on  the horses . With another furious snort , it gained the top of the bank  and bounded toward where they stood hitched , chewing their hay .  The tired white horses looked up suddenly from their hay , and  perceiving this black apparition of the forest , snorted and tugged at  their halters .  With a frightful bellow , half squeal , half roar , the moose rose twelve  feet tall on his hind legs , and rushed at the one hitched nearest .  The horse broke its halter , ran headlong against its mate , recoiled ,  bumped into a tree trunk , and then -- the trees standing thick in front  of it -- backed over the bank and went out of sight down the bluff , the  moose bounding after it , still bellowing hoarsely .  The other horse had also broken its halter and ran off , while the two  boys stood amazed and alarmed at this tremendous exhibition of animal  ferocity .  "" Nat ! Nat ! He will kill that horse ! "" Jonathan exclaimed , and they both  ran to look over the bank . Horse and moose were now down near the  water , where the river ran deep and swift under the steep bank , the  horse trying vainly to escape through the tangled alder brush , the  moose savagely pursuing .  The sight roused the boys to save their horse . Axe in hand , Jonathan  ran and slid down the bluff side , catching hold of trees and bushes as  he did so , to keep from going quite into the river . Nat followed him ,  with the gun which he had hastily primed . Both horse and moose were now  thrashing amidst the alder clumps .  "" Shoot him , shoot him ! "" Jonathan shouted . "" Why do n't you fire ? Oh , let  me have that gun ! ""  It is not as easy"	1	0
"As often as Nat tried to steady himself on the  steep side of the bluff for a shot , either the horse was in the way or  both animals were wholly concealed by the bushes . Moreover , the boys  had to run fast through the brush to keep them in sight . Nat could not  shoot with certainty , and Jonathan grew wild over the delay .  "" Shoot him yourself , then ! "" Nat retorted , panting .  Jonathan snatched the gun and dashed forward , Nat picking up the axe  and following after . On they ran for several hundred yards , barely  keeping pace with the animals . Jonathan experienced quite as much  difficulty in getting a shot as Nat had done .  At last he aimed and snapped -- and the gun did not go off .  "" You never primed it ! "" he exclaimed indignantly . Nat thought that he  had done so , but was not wholly certain ; and feeling that he must  do his part somehow , he now dashed past Jonathan , and running on ,  attempted to head the horse off at a little gully down the bank to  which they had now come . It was a brushy place ; he fell headlong  into it himself , and rolled down , still grasping hard at the axe . He  was close upon the horse now , within a few yards of the water , and  looking up , he saw the moose 's head among the alder brush . The creature  appeared to be staring at him , and regaining his feet , much excited ,  Nat threw the axe with all his strength at the moose 's head .  By chance rather than skill , the poll of the axe struck the animal  just above the eyes at the root of the antlers . It staggered , holding  its head to one side a moment , as if half - stunned or in pain . Then ,  recovering , it snorted , and with a bound through the brush , jumped into  the stream , and either swam or waded across to the low sandy bank on  the other side . There it stood , still shaking its head .  Jonathan had caught up with Nat by this time , and they both stood  watching the moose for some moments , hoping that the mad animal had now  had enough of the fracas and would go his way . The horse was in the  brush of the little gully , sticking fast there , or tired out by its  exertions ; and they now began considering how they could best extricate  it and get it back up the bluff .  Just then"	1	0
" "" He 's coming again ! "" exclaimed Jonathan . "" Have you got the powder - horn ,  Nat ? Give it to me quick , if you 've got it ! "" Nathaniel had had the  powder - horn up on the bank , but had dropped it there , or lost it out of  his pocket in his scramble down the bluff .  There was no time to search for it . The moose was plunging through the  narrow stream , and a moment later sprang ashore and came bounding up  the gully toward the horse .  The boys shouted to frighten him off . The crazy creature appeared  neither to hear nor heed . Jonathan hastily took refuge behind a rock ;  Nat jumped to cover of a tree trunk .  In his rush at the horse , the moose passed close to them . Again Nat  hurled the axe at the animal 's side . Jonathan , snatching up a heavy  stone , threw it with all his might . The horse , too , wheeling in the  narrow bed of the gully , kicked spitefully , lashing out its iron - shod  hoofs again and again , planting them hard on the moose 's front .  For some moments this singular combat raged there . Recovering the axe  and coming up behind the animal , Nat now attempted to deal a blow . The  moose wheeled , however , as if struck by sudden panic , and went clear  over Nat , who was thrown headlong and slid down into the water .  The moose bounded clear over him , and again went splashing through  the Little Androscoggin to the other side , where it turned as before ,  shaking its antlers and rending the brush with them .  Nathaniel had caught hold of a bush , and thus saved himself from going  fully into the swift current . Jonathan helped him get out , and the two  young fellows stared at each other . The encounter had given them proof  of the mad strength and energy of the moose .  "" Oh , if we could only find that powder - horn somewhere ! "" Jonathan  exclaimed .  The horse up on the bluff sent forth again its shrill neigh , to which  the one beside them responded .  And just as before , the moose , with an awful bellow , came plunging  through the little river and bounding up the gully .  "" My soul ! Here he comes again ! "" Jonathan fairly yelled . "" Get out o ' the  way ! ""  And Nat got out of the way as quickly as possible , taking refuge behind  the same rock in the"	1	0
